We will then deep dive explore the critical technical competencies we have identified for the role, and then we will deep dive in behavioral competencies. The most aligned candidate will then be asked to do a practical work task simulation activity so we can make sure that you will enjoy the kind of work the role requires, and this task will typically be presented and discussed with a group of colleagues and managers.",

    "description": "Work Environment Company Culture Monadical is a fully-remote software consultancy that prides ourselves on maintaining a healthy work/life balance and supportive remote working culture. We strive to build a diverse, friendly, and knowledgeable team, and expose ourselves to a variety of industries and learning environments. We work with a wide range of clients on medium/large projects, ranging from 3-12+ months. The industries we’ve worked with are varied, from real-estate to finance to biomedicine and neuroscience. Most of our clients find us via word-of-mouth or by reading our blog posts and watching our employees talks. We try to build our company structure to ensure employees have lots of freedom to choose the projects they enjoy most, and the power to have a real impact on product decisions and company direction. We also have a strong set of company principles that drive who we work with and how we maintain our culture. The company principles handbook is a collaborative, public effort and is editable by any employee by submitting a pull-request. Perks Some perks of working with us include: Work from home (we’re fully remote!) Flexible working hours Six weeks of paid vacation Competitive salary Time, funding, and support for self-improvement/blogging/talks/side-projects/FOSS contribution Strong culture emphasis on individual autonomy and impact on company direction Job description We’re looking for Senior Full-Stack Developers with team leadership experience. Candidates should have strong professional experience with modern web development environments, along with excellent problem-solving and debugging skills across systems. Most importantly, we value open and inclusive communication. We seek candidates who can communicate fluently with team members, as well as with clients and managers, to extract product requirements and define a development path with accurate time estimates. We are looking for developers who demonstrate curiosity and a strong desire to learn and improve, with a high level of self-direction and motivation. We’re a fully remote company, so you should be comfortable getting things done and directing team members with little oversight! That said, we enjoy each other’s company on our shared chat system and calls, and we have a regular check-in habit to keep everyone informed about each other’s work and side projects. We’re looking for a Senior Full-Stack Developer with project management experience and the ability to lead teams. The ideal candidate should have a basic understanding of machine learning systems—particularly LLMs—and strong UI/UX design and user research skills to help us build more thoughtful AI-powered products. Experience with ML model deployment and LLM application development is a plus. We also welcome applications from candidates with strong DevOps experience! Minimum requirements • Backend: Strong experience with Python | NodeJS | TypeScrypt • Frontend: Strong experience with React based web development • Client management and product management experience • Strong communication skills • Available during Eastern working hours (10am - 5pm EST, flexible) • ** Based in Canada** Nice-to-have skills • Experience with native or mobile development (e.g. iOS/Android/React Native/etc.) • Experience with MLOps, data storage solutions, and cloud platforms • Experience with Rust or crypto • Familiarity with large-scale data processing and distributed computing frameworks • Knowledge of machine learning principles and algorithms • Strong background in mathematics • Located in or near Montréal Application Process Our application process is easy and transparent: • 15min: Take an untimed coding test and access the application form upon passing. • 45min: Non-coding conversational interview Chat with Ana (no whiteboarding or quizzing theory/architecture/etc) • 2-6 hr: Small untimed take-home project See https://docs.monadical.com/s/monadical-study-guide for more details. • 60 min: Pairing interview: Add a feature to take-home project with a lead developer First 10 min: Discuss your take-home project and the current state of their code. Next 10 min: Have you step into the shoes of a product manager and discuss potential features to add to their project. Frame it as if it’s a client project and have you explain your thought process when gathering requirements, prioritizing tickets, delegating, and making time estimates. Last 40-60 min: Pair on adding a feature to the codebase together. This interview is to gauge the experience of working together on a technical task, not to measure raw coding speed. We’re more impressed by people who talk clearly through their thought process and code deliberately, than those who try to add as many features as possible in a short time. Treat the task of adding a feature as if it were an un-timed take-home task, and focus on explaining your decisions, more than sheer lines-of-code output during the interview. We’ve all had interview jitters, so if the feature was not completed during pairing or if you feel the interview wasn’t a good representation of your abilities, you’re welcome to push further commits up to 24 hours afterward with a short description of the changes made, and we’ll include it with equal weight when evaluating the codebase. • 60min: Pairing interview: same structure as above, pairing with another lead developer The whole process usually takes 2-3 weeks depending on the applicant pipeline and response times.

You’re not building another feature flag for a SaaS dashboard. You’re writing backend systems that support machine learning models tasked with identifying truth (or at least a statistically reliable approximation of it) in an industry built on uncertainty: insurance. This is not a vibe-based startup. It's a well-capitalized AI company where engineering decisions are consequential and the work is rooted in measurable outcomes. The product helps insurers detect fraudulent claims using a data-driven platform that aims to remove bias—because the stakes aren’t likes or clicks; they’re dollars and liability. You’ll be the kind of engineer who prefers to spend time writing backend Python that automates infrastructure logic, builds internal tools, or glues together machine learning pipelines in AWS. Terraform is here, obviously. So are EC2, RDS, Lambda, and other expected acronyms. But what sets this apart is the opportunity to shape how it all functions—functionally. And yes, this role is onsite, in Toronto or Vancouver. You’ll be around other engineers who care about systems, not just shipping tickets. Required Skills & Experience • 3–6 years of experience in software engineering, with real backend Python contributions—ideally building infrastructure tools, internal APIs, or deployment logic • Solid experience with AWS tooling and a habit of understanding the why, not just the how • Proven experience with infrastructure-as-code tooling like Terraform or AWS CDK Desired Skills & Experience • Comfort overseeing Monitoring and reliability Familiarity with CI/CD tooling and systems that don’t fall apart under pressure Daily Responsibilities • Hands-On Engineering: 70% • Team Collaboration & Cross-Functional Work: 30% Applicants must be currently authorized to work in Canada on a full-time basis now and in the future.

You will manage IAM roles, policies, and access controls to ensure secure environments, implement enterprise-grade authentication mechanisms (OAuth2, OpenID, SSO), enforce high availability and compliance baselines. Furthermore, you will conduct vulnerability assessments and respond to security incidents using GuardDuty and Security Hub, and ensure compliance with standards like SOC2, HIPAA, and ISO. You will monitor system health with CloudWatch and implement auto-remediation strategies and troubleshoot complex production issues to maintain optimal performance. • Beyond technical delivery, you will play a leadership role: conducting architecture and code reviews, mentoring junior engineers, maintaining infrastructure documentation, runbooks, and automation scripts, and collaborating across product and platform teams to align on best practices, drive DevOps culture, and cloud-native adoption. You will stay current with AWS innovations and continuously improve operational efficiency. Candidates with contributions to open-source projects, technical blogs, or experience with platforms like Backstage or Temporal.io will be highly valued, as these demonstrate thought leadership and community engagement.

    "description": "It's no secret that traditional site reliability teams struggle to keep pace with manual monitoring, reactive troubleshooting, and labor-intensive deployments. The rise of AI presents a solution, but many companies fail to fully leverage its potential, resulting in systems that underperform and bottlenecks that stifle innovation. Data shows that 73% of companies struggle with deployment delays and operational downtime, primarily due to outdated processes and lack of AI-driven automation. At IgniteTech, we are tackling these issues head-on by building AI-first cloud solutions that are designed to anticipate and prevent problems before they arise. We focus on integrating AI and machine learning into every facet of cloud infrastructure management, from automated monitoring systems to intelligent CI/CD pipelines. This approach creates environments that not only self-heal but also continuously evolve, reducing downtime, improving performance, and pushing the boundaries of what cloud services can do. This isn’t your typical site reliability role, where you'd be reacting to problems and manually intervening when things go wrong. Here, you’ll lead the charge in building AI-enhanced monitoring systems that detect and resolve 95% of issues before they ever reach end users. You’ll also architect and manage AI-automated CI/CD pipelines that reduce deployment times by 30% while slashing manual interventions. The ideal candidate thrives in an AI-driven environment, is excited by the prospect of automation-first solutions, and enjoys pushing the envelope of cloud infrastructure design.

    "description": "It's no secret that traditional site reliability teams struggle to keep pace with manual monitoring, reactive troubleshooting, and labor-intensive deployments. The rise of AI presents a solution, but many companies fail to fully leverage its potential, resulting in systems that underperform and bottlenecks that stifle innovation. Data shows that 73% of companies struggle with deployment delays and operational downtime, primarily due to outdated processes and lack of AI-driven automation. At IgniteTech, we are tackling these issues head-on by building AI-first cloud solutions that are designed to anticipate and prevent problems before they arise. We focus on integrating AI and machine learning into every facet of cloud infrastructure management, from automated monitoring systems to intelligent CI/CD pipelines. This approach creates environments that not only self-heal but also continuously evolve, reducing downtime, improving performance, and pushing the boundaries of what cloud services can do. This isn’t your typical site reliability role, where you'd be reacting to problems and manually intervening when things go wrong. Here, you’ll lead the charge in building AI-enhanced monitoring systems that detect and resolve 95% of issues before they ever reach end users. You’ll also architect and manage AI-automated CI/CD pipelines that reduce deployment times by 30% while slashing manual interventions. The ideal candidate thrives in an AI-driven environment, is excited by the prospect of automation-first solutions, and enjoys pushing the envelope of cloud infrastructure design. In this role, you’ll join a global team of innovators who are redefining cloud infrastructure. Your work will play a key role in our mission to deliver next-gen, AI-driven operational excellence.

    "description": "Creative Market is the world's preferred one-stop shop for the creator community - a platform where creators from across the globe buy and sell digital, high-quality design assets. We're passionate about building tools and experiences that make design beautiful, effective, and accessible to everyone. With many jobs, you have to pick between having a huge impact on the organization (small team) or having a huge impact on the world (big product), but at Creative Market - you get to do both! You get to work on a digital asset marketplace, as part of a fully remote team, that has more than 30 million quality resources created by artists in 148 countries around the world. At Creative Market, we serve a global community and we need a diverse team to do that successfully. Women; people of colour; members of the LGBTQ+ community; and people of all backgrounds, religions, gender identities, individuals with disabilities, and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply. We provide an accessible candidate experience, and if you need any accommodations or adjustments throughout the interview process and beyond, please let us know. We're dedicated to fostering an inclusive and diverse environment for employees from all walks of life. We're building a fully remote team across Canada and the United States. We believe that creative collaboration can happen anywhere, and that working remotely shouldn't have to mean sacrificing a sense of cohesion, community, and connection. We've seen that by combining thoughtful collaboration, frequent communication, and the freedom for people to be their authentic selves, you can do your best work and inspire others to do the same. About the role: We're looking for a Senior Analytics Engineer to help build and evolve Creative Market's data platform, using tools from the modern data stack such as dbt, Snowflake, Metabase, Dagster, and Amplitude. At Creative Market, our data function exists to provide accurate, timely, and insightful reporting to stakeholders throughout the organization, as well as create value through various data science initiatives. As a Senior Analytics Engineer, you'll play a pivotal role in shaping our data-driven decision-making process and provide advanced insights to drive business growth and innovation. Reporting to our VP of Product, you'll lead initiatives to leverage data for strategic recommendations and collaborate across teams to enhance our data platform. This role offers a unique opportunity to take ownership of our analytics function and drive its evolution! You will further build our self-serve data platform by following software engineering best practices such as version control and continuous integration - developing intuitive, tested, and documented data models, and creating reliable dashboards. Working with our Engineering team, you'll help to define tracking requirements and ensure we have access to the data we need for impactful insights. You'll also collaborate frequently with Product, Marketing, Sales, and our leadership team to transform data into meaningful stories that guide confident, informed decisions! As a Senior Analytics Engineer, you'll be responsible for: • Leading efforts to define and build success metrics for Marketing and Product programs and campaigns that drive meaningful growth. • Delivering well-defined, transformed, tested, documented, and code-reviewed datasets that enable confident decision making. • Proactively analyzing data and insights, and communicating clear opportunities to stakeholders to drive performance. This is not a passive reporting role. • Working with Product Managers to analyze customer trends and product performance to improve company OKRs. • Conducting exploratory analysis to uncover new areas of opportunity, generate hypotheses, and quickly assess and clearly communicate the potential upside of a given opportunity. This person will make recommendations based on findings to drive quality business decisions. • Managing the integration of tracking requirements for new products and features, and collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to ensure accurate data capture. • Identifying and integrating valuable data sources using ETL tools (e.g. Fivetran, Stitch) or custom pipelines in Python (we use Dagster). • Collaborating with research and engineering teams to improve data models that feed business intelligence tools, increase data accessibility, and foster data-driven decision making across the organization. • Implementing processes and systems to monitor data quality, ensuring production data is always accurate and available for key stakeholders that depend on it. • Developing and maintaining scalable data pipelines and building out new API integrations to support growth in data volume and complexity. • Defining and maintaining clear data documentation, definitions, and governance to ensure consistency across metrics like MAU and MRR. • Translating analytical findings into strategic recommendations that drive product enhancements, customer satisfaction, and revenue growth. We believe it's important for you to have: • 5+ years of experience in data analysis or analytics engineering roles with a progressive increase in responsibility. • Advanced proficiency in SQL. You have experience querying large and complex datasets efficiently and structuring queries that are both performant and easy to understand. Experience with dbt and building well-structured DAGs of data models is a strong plus! • Proficiency with Metabase or a similar BI tool. • Proven data wrangling and modeling skills.

    "location": "Toronto, ON",
    "description": "About Thri5 Thri5 is the AI-powered System of Actions for the modern retailer. Despite massive investments in planning, forecasting, and analytics, retailers still face the same operational issues—out-of-stocks, bad master data, margin leakage, and inconsistent execution across stores and channels. The gap isn’t in intelligence; it’s in execution. Thri5 continually scans data across the business, detects and prioritizes opportunities, evaluates impact, and orchestrates execution through both humans and AI agents. From store managers and DC leaders to category and supply chain teams, Thri5 routes the right actions to the right owners—with clear context, recommendations, and workflows—closing the gap between plan and real-world performance. Our vision is to become the trusted AI operating layer for retail execution, making every operator 10x more effective and freeing them to focus on what matters most: serving customers and growing the business. Founded by a team with deep retail and retail-technology experience, Thri5 is venture-backed by some of Canada’s most prominent VC and angel investors. Your Role As an AI / Machine Learning Engineer at Thri5, you’ll help build the agent layer that powers our System of Actions. You’ll design and implement multi-agent Co-pilot systems that orchestrate complex workflows, call tools and APIs, and automate operational tasks at scale. You’ll also develop deterministic, data-driven detection models to reliably identify operational issues and opportunities—and then layer LLM-based capabilities on top to generate high-quality alerts, recommended actions, and explanations grounded in real retail data. You’ll work closely with the founding team to turn messy, real-world retail problems into robust, production agent workflows that operators actually trust and use every day. Key Responsibilities Agent Framework & Orchestration • Design and build the core frameworks that power Thri5’s AI agents: task decomposition, routing, tool calling, multi-step workflows, and human-in-the-loop escalation. • Implement agents that coordinate across operators (store, DC, category, supply chain) and systems to drive real actions, not just insights. LLM-Driven Intelligence • Develop and fine-tune LLM-based components to detect anomalies and opportunities that impact commercial and operational performance. • Build prompt, retrieval, and grounding patterns that produce reliable behaviour in noisy, real-world data. • Combine deterministic signals with LLMs to produce contextual narratives, explanations, and recommended actions. Deterministic Detection & Scoring • Design and implement deterministic and semi-deterministic detection models (e.g., statistical anomaly detection, rules + ML hybrids, scoring systems) to identify out-of-stocks, bad master data, and execution gaps. • Build evaluation frameworks (precision/recall, false positive control, business impact, backtests) to ensure detections are trustworthy and stable in production. • Collaborate with product and domain experts to translate heuristics and business rules into robust, maintainable detection logic. Data & Recommendation Pipelines • Build and optimize pipelines that leverage real-time and batch customer data (transactions, inventory, operations) to power agent decisions and recommendations. • Own end-to-end ML workflows—data preprocessing, feature engineering, training, evaluation, and production inference. MLOps / LLMOps & Reliability • Implement robust MLOps practices for CI/CD, experimentation, and monitoring of models and agents. • Instrument and monitor agent behaviour (latency, cost, quality, safety) and continuously iterate to improve performance, accuracy, and scalability. Collaboration & Product • Partner with product and engineering to translate customer problems into concrete agent capabilities and use cases. • Contribute to technical decision-making and architecture as we scale the Thri5 platform. Requirements • AI Fluency: 5+ years of software development experience with deep exposure to modern AI/ML, including both classical ML / data science and LLMs, GPT-style models, and agent/tool-calling ecosystems. • ML / Data Science Proficiency: Strong background in supervised/unsupervised learning and anomaly detection, with hands-on experience designing deterministic or semi-deterministic detection systems (statistical models, rules + ML, scoring). Comfortable with model evaluation, experimentation, and translating business heuristics into data-driven logic. • Programming & Frameworks: Proficient in Python and familiar with ML frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. Experience with GenAI tooling (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, custom agent frameworks) and vector databases is an asset. • Data Handling: Comfortable working with large-scale datasets, complex schemas, and event-driven data. Strong SQL skills and experience building data pipelines into production systems. • Startup Mindset: Thrive in a fast-paced, ambiguous environment; able to bring structure to open-ended problems. Enjoy high accountability and end-to-end ownership from idea to production impact. • Teamwork: Collaborative, low-ego, and comfortable working across a small, high-performing team (founders, engineers, product, and customers). • Domain Experience (Nice to Have): Experience in retail, supply chain, predictive analytics, time-series modeling, or operational optimization. • Education: Bachelor’s, Master’s or Ph.D. in Computer Science, Data Science, Machine Learning, or a related field (or equivalent practical experience).",

We’re helping a fast-moving, quality-driven team find their next Senior QA Engineer . Someone who doesn’t just test software but takes full ownership of product quality and plays a key role in driving projects to a smooth, successful launch.

Required Skills and Experience • 3+ years in a QA or software testing role. • Strong foundation in software testing theory and practice. • Familiarity with the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Agile methodologies. • Hands-on experience with Jira . • Comfort with at least one automated testing framework or language (e.g., Selenium , Cypress , Appium , Python , Java , JavaScript ). • Excellent communication and collaboration skills. • Strong analytical thinking and a solution-oriented mindset.

You'll join a collaborative team of four other designers, reporting to the Design Director, contributing to the business's strategic success. What you’ll do • Problem Discovery, Definition & Goal Setting: You’ll collaborate with your team to ensure that problems, initiatives, and outcomes are well-defined and documented based on objective data. You’ll help facilitate discovery sessions and workshops that align your team around clearly defined problem statements and goals. • Interaction Design: You know when and why to apply interaction design processes to achieve the right outcomes with your team.

Your work product will include journey maps, service blueprints, information architecture, user flows, and wireframes. • Art Direction & Visual Design: You’ll design the high-fidelity interfaces that we build. You understand how to convey visual personality, tone, look and feel, and the flourish that is appropriate to your product. • Design Systems Thinking: You’ll ensure that design solutions utilize and further the team's design system, and leverage or iterate on existing patterns whenever possible. You’ll identify undefined or inconsistent patterns and propose scalable solutions. You’ll encourage and facilitate the shared naming of elements across design and development on the team. • Design Research, Validation & Iteration: You’ll contribute to and lead user and market research activities and synthesize their results.

You're comfortable with being uncomfortable, and approach difficult situations with optimism. You care personally, challenge directly, and communicate with candor and courage. • The Critical Thinker: You ask questions to clarify ambiguous problems and listen actively in order to understand opportunities to improve experiences and processes. • Collaborative: We are all building tools that ladder or nest into one another. Being able to take design cues from others’ patterns and explorations is critical. • Design Data-Heavy Screens: You can take a page of tables and metrics and make it into an easy-to-scan dashboard that tells the story of a products performance. You can balance UX and UI to make it beautiful. • Pivot Easily: We’ve been building a lot of new things, and with that come changing timelines, requirements, ideas and mandates. We support each other to take it in stride. Your qualifications should include: • 5+ years of Product Design (UX/UI) experience in cross-functional teams. • Experience launching complex B2B SaaS products (ideally in ad tech, marketing automation, or enterprise software) and/or impactful consumer-facing experiences is considered a nice to have.

We’re training and deploying frontier models for developers and enterprises who are building AI systems to power magical experiences like content generation, semantic search, RAG, and agents. We believe that our work is instrumental to the widespread adoption of AI. We obsess over what we build. Each one of us is responsible for contributing to increasing the capabilities of our models and the value they drive for our customers. We like to work hard and move fast to do what’s best for our customers. Cohere is a team of researchers, engineers, designers, and more, who are passionate about their craft. Each person is one of the best in the world at what they do. We believe that a diverse range of perspectives is a requirement for building great products. Join us on our mission and shape the future! About the Native team On this product team, you will be responsible for bringing North to iOS and Android, translating our web experience into native-first interfaces that feel at home on mobile platforms. You'll help define the vision for North Native, determining what to adapt, what to reimagine, and what new capabilities mobile unlocks. This role requires fluency in both web and native design patterns, understanding when to maintain consistency with our existing experience and when platform conventions should take precedence. You'll be shaping the early product experience and design patterns that will serve as the foundation of North Native. In this role, you will: • Own the design process end-to-end for Native experiences. Collaborate with Product on the mobile product vision and translate complex web workflows into intuitive native experiences optimized for iOS and Android. • Balance consistency with our web platform against native platform conventions, making thoughtful decisions about when to align and when to diverge based on user context and platform strengths. • Design with platform-specific patterns and capabilities in mind—leveraging native gestures, notifications, widgets, and system integrations to create experiences that feel truly native. • Partner closely with product managers and engineers throughout the development lifecycle, collaborating on technical feasibility, implementation details, and platform-specific constraints. • Conduct user research to understand mobile-specific use cases, behaviours, and expectations, ensuring Native delivers unique value rather than simply replicating the web experience. • Establish design patterns and guidelines for Native that scale across both platforms while accommodating platform-specific needs and future mobile capabilities. You're likely a good fit if you have: • Product Design Experience: 3+ years designing digital products with a strong portfolio that demonstrates your process, systems thinking, and measurable impact on user outcomes. • Cross-Functional Partnership: A collaborative approach to product development—working closely with Product Managers to identify opportunities, with Engineers to navigate technical constraints and review implementations, and with stakeholders across the organization to align on solutions. • User-Centered Approach: A deep commitment to understanding user needs through research and direct engagement. You drive research initiatives, translate findings into design decisions, and stay informed on industry trends and AI developments that shape the product landscape. • Craft Excellence: Meticulous attention to craft and detail. You're proficient in Figma, build scalable component systems, and consistently elevate the quality of everything you touch. Bonus points for strong visual design skills in typography, layout, color, and composition. • Communication Skills: Clear, proactive communication that keeps distributed teams aligned. You document decisions, articulate design rationale to diverse audiences, and create shared understanding across geographies and disciplines. If some of the above doesn’t line up perfectly with your experience, we still encourage you to apply! We value and celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive work environment for all. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and are committed to providing equal opportunities. Should you require any accommodations during the recruitment process, please submit an Accommodations Request Form, and we will work together to meet your needs.

We’re not just building an app—we’re building unstoppable teams. So what do you say, are you in? Your Impact Starts Here As a Senior Product Designer at Homebase, you'll tackle meaningful problems for small businesses and the hourly workers who power them. This role requires someone who can navigate complexity—understanding how workflows connect across a business, knowing when AI can genuinely help and how to apply it, and translating messy real-world constraints into experiences that feel effortless. Where you land will depend on your strengths and our evolving needs, but one thing is certain: you'll own work that matters. Here's how you'll contribute: • Lead with Curiosity: Dive into unfamiliar problem spaces, ask better questions, and bring a genuine eagerness to understand our customers—their constraints, their workarounds, their goals. • Design for Connected Systems: Think beyond individual screens. Our products—scheduling, time tracking, payroll, hiring, team communication—are deeply interconnected. You'll design solutions that make sense within a larger ecosystem, not just in isolation. • Thrive in Ambiguity: Push forward when the path isn't clear. You'll shape direction, not just follow it—bringing structure to fuzzy problems and momentum to early-stage work. • Craft with Intention: Ground your UI decisions in strong UX foundations. Every interaction should help someone get their job done with less friction. • Embrace AI as a Tool: Use AI to accelerate your own work and design experiences where AI genuinely serves the user—not just because it's novel. • Move Fast: Speed is our edge. Prioritize ruthlessly, make decisions, learn, and adapt. The Foundation for Success - These are the experiences and strengths that will set you up for success in this role: • Seasoned Leadership: Demonstrated leadership capabilities, with a track record of inspiring teams and peers, and driving complex projects to success. • Recent native mobile experience: while you won’t be limited to native experiences, recent experience (within the last 3 years) is a significant and critical part of this role. • Master of UI/UX: Exceptional skills in both User Interface and User Experience design, clearly demonstrated through a distinguished portfolio. • Strategic Thinker: Adept at understanding and implementing large-scale business implications of design decisions within the tech landscape. • AI Proficiency: Extensive experience with AI tools in design, enhancing both process and product quality. • Proven experience in platform and messaging product design. • Up-to-date with the latest industry trends and AI technologies. The Homie Way - These principles guide everything we do—from how we work and make decisions to how we show up for each other. • Be Customer Obsessed – Solve problems with empathy and creativity. • Move Fast, Learn Fast – Experiment, take action, and grow every day. • Own Your Impact – Think big, focus on what matters, and make decisions you stand behind. • Master Your Craft – Excellence fuels impact—show up, step up, and make your mark. • Win Together – Put goals over roles, lead with trust, and connect to our mission and each other. What We Offer • Ownership & Financial Security: Stock options + 401(k) with 4% match • Comprehensive Healthcare: Medical, dental, and vision coverage + FSA options • Flexible Time: Unlimited PTO (salaried) + company holidays • Family Support: Up to 12 weeks of paid parental leave (after 6 months of service) • Protection Plans: Life insurance + short/long-term disability coverage • Work Your Way: Work From Anywhere Month + meeting-free weeks yearly • Workspace Perks: Meals provided, commuter benefits, team offsites, and Customer Days • Our Hybrid Rhythm: We believe collaboration drives impact. That’s why Tuesday and Wednesday are our required in-office days—a time to move faster as a team, build deeper connections, make better decisions, and build together. What to Expect During the Interview Process • Meet the Talent Acquisition team. • Meet one of our Design Leaders. • Participate in a Talent Showcase • Meet Cross-functional Partners • Background Check + Offer Stage • Welcome to the team, Homie Belonging at Homebase - We're committed to fostering a welcoming space where every Homie can be their full self. Experience comes in many forms—so if you're excited about this role, even if you don’t meet 100% of the qualifications, we encourage you to apply!

    "description": "In most companies, traditional customer support is often plagued by inefficiency and mediocrity. Support engineers frequently waste time on repetitive tasks or struggle with problems outside their narrow expertise. Data shows that over 60% of tickets get escalated because the first line of defense lacks the skills or knowledge to resolve them. At Trilogy, we don’t do traditional. Managing over 100 enterprise software products, we’ve redefined customer support with advanced AI. Most issues are handled by our AI-powered chatbot, leaving only the most complex challenges for our engineers. That means every ticket you touch is difficult, varied, and requires creative problem-solving. In this role, there’s no time for hand-holding or “learning the ropes” at a leisurely pace. If you need constant guidance, struggle to self-learn, or tend to ask obvious questions, you won’t last two weeks. Success requires a proactive mindset, the ability to adapt quickly, and the drive to figure things out independently. If you’re ready to step up and tackle the toughest problems in customer support, this role will accelerate your growth like nothing else. You’ll gain unparalleled technical expertise across a massive product portfolio while contributing directly to Trilogy’s reputation for excellence. If you are up to the task of pushing your limits, we’d love to see you apply. What you will be doing • AI-Augmented Customer Resolutions: Analyze complex tickets escalated by AI systems, apply human expertise to areas where AI falls short, and then close the gap by improving the AI system What you won’t be doing • Taking two whole months to get up to speed; you will be expected to ramp up one several products within the first month (we are aware this is aggressive) • Relying on your managers for help; if you are not adept at unblocking yourself, you will likely struggle in this role L2 Customer Support Engineer key responsibilities • Integrate technical human expertise and AI capabilities to deliver exceptional customer support, focusing on complex issues that AI cannot yet fully resolve Basic Requirements • At least 3 total years of experience in a technical customer support role • Advanced generative AI proficiency (i.e., use of multiple AI tools, ability to automate workflows and custom GPTs); if you've only used LLMs for research, learning, brainstorming, or content generation, that will be deemed insufficient • Currently based in North or South America About Trilogy Hundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses. Our technological innovation is spearheaded by a passion for simple customer-facing designs. Our incubation of new businesses ranges from entirely new moon-shot ideas to rearchitecting existing projects for today's modern cloud-based stack. Trilogy is a place where you can be surrounded with great people, be proud of doing great work, and grow your career by leaps and bounds.",

    "description": "Oh, hello there, wearer of many hats. Funday is a full service agency made up of people who are friendly and hardworking in equal measure. Inspired by an unrelenting belief that having fun is integral to creativity, we like to say we’re all about fun and brains. You know, that sweet spot between where pretty and performance meet and where insight and imagination produce the entirely unexpected? That’s where we thrive. Engagement Manager We are looking for an experienced account manager who is also skilled in project management; this role is a hybrid, and we need someone who has a diverse skill set that bridges the project and account worlds. One minute you’ll discuss the details of a project’s deliverables with the creative team and the next, you’ll be talking budgets with your client. These roles aren’t always combined, but when they are, it’s pretty fun. You will report to the Client Services Director and will be expected run your own account(s), work with team members at all levels, and may be expected to support senior client service team members on larger accounts, as necessary. Our clients and our team members are scattered around the globe. We’re a smaller group, so everyone gets their hands dirty. You’ll always be working with a team who has a passion for great work, including creatives, strategists and technologists who will help you push the work forward. Location – You will work remotely from anywhere in AB, BC, or ON. What you’ll do Account Management Responsibilities - A strong account manager takes the time to understand the client and their business and can even anticipate their needs. They are the bridge between the client and our internal team; they ensure clear communication between both sides and have the tough conversations when necessary. • Support senior client services team members on larger client accounts where needed • Own the success of your account, drawing support from the strategy, creative and leadership teams • Be the primary contact for projects between the client, team, and vendors • Identify opportunities to deliver on client’s needs, solve problems, and grow the account • Build positive working relationships with key client teams • Understand and anticipate clients’ short and long-term goals • Manage issues in a professional and timely manner, finding solutions and consensus among all parties Project Management Responsibilities - A strong project manager takes the time to understand what it is the client needs so they can take that information back to the team and communicate it in a way that they can easily get to creating the magic. They are very organized and scheduled but can stop everything and switch directions at the drop of a hat. • Support senior client service team members with project management on larger client accounts as necessary • Ensure everything is in place to run and execute a project on time and within budget • Translate the clients’ needs into a language the team understands to get the work done • Conduct thorough scoping, planning, costing, and timing of projects • Oversee the entire delivery and execution process, ensuring and facilitating effective team communication and collaboration • Own, facilitate, and document outcomes for meetings • Manage development priorities and timelines • Manage creative activities and client reviews • Communicate project status/risks to stakeholders • Identify, document, and communicate issues and changes that may affect the project What you’ll need to succeed • Minimum 2 years experience in an advertising agency required • 3 years in an account management or hybrid role • Proven ability to move between the accounts and project worlds • Experience managing projects through the entire lifecycle, from planning to execution • A “how can we make this even better” approach to projects • Attention to detail and strong organizational and people management skills • Excellent communication, presentation, and facilitation skills • Flexibility when faced with changing priorities or circumstances • Experience with project management and issue tracking tools • Experience with budgeting and resource management • Experience managing teams and conversations with clients around all aspects of a project You’ll want to read this part • If you live in Canada, are able to work here, and you are in one of these provinces: BC, AB or ON - please apply! Otherwise, we’re sorry, we’re not set up to support staff outside of these regions. • Please note: we post the same role in multiple locations to help us cast a wide net. Applying to each location for a posting will not increase your chances. Now that we've saved you some time, go do something fun! • This posting is for an existing vacancy we are looking to fill immediately and not a prospective future role (i.e. we’re saying this isn’t a ghost job) Come be a Funatic We believe you won’t perform at your best if you’re not having fun. And you can’t have fun if you’re not performing. We believe this creates the best client + agency relationships and is the best way to make great work. We believe in respect, inclusivity, kindness, equity, and equality. We want to make a positive impact. We believe that collaboration is the fun part of being at work. We strive to create a culture in which “we” is more important than “me”. Apart from loving terrible fun puns, we’re also 100% remote, and that might not appeal to everyone – but if you value flexibility, it’s perfect. Join us.",
