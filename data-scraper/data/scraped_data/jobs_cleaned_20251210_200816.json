    "title": "Software Engineer II (Full Stack, Backend-leaning)",
    "company_name": "Jerry",
    "location": "Toronto, ON",
    "description": "👋 Hi! We’re Jerry.ai. We’re building the first AI-powered AllCar™ super app to make car ownership affordable, seamless, and even magical. From insurance to repairs to road safety, we’re connecting the entire car ownership experience into one mobile-first platform. Our revenue has grown 60x in the last 5 years, we’re profitable, and our goal is to scale from 5M → 50M users next. We’re looking for a Software Engineer II to join our Core Marketplace Automation Team, building automation systems that let our users self-serve, stay insured, and get the smoothest experience possible. This is a rare opportunity to work on software that directly impacts millions of users, automate complex business processes, and shape the future of insurance tech. Why you’ll love working here • Real world impact: Your code touches millions of end users every day. Our automation systems already handle complex tasks like document uploads/verification, policy changes, payment, cancellations, and renewals — now we need to make them faster, smarter, and more seamless. • Meaningful work: Build tools that automate hundreds of human agent hours and scale our business efficiently. You’ll tackle different types of challenges every day, learning both the technical and business sides of our core products. • Zero bureaucracy: Have an idea? Pitch it, implement it, and see it live in days. No red tape, no slow-moving processes. • Brilliant + supportive teammates: Work with talented and kind engineers, product managers, and data scientists. Be in an environment that encourages challenging the status quo, innovation, collaboration, and helping each other succeed. • Flexibility: Work on projects that excite you. Explore new technologies, like AI/LLM tools, early — without bureaucracy slowing you down. Remote-friendly and flexible work arrangements allowing you to balance life and work, even internationally. • Growth + learning: Engineers at Jerry get to take a ton of ownership, swim outside their lanes, level up quickly, and mentor others. Everyone is passionate, involved, and cares intensely about their work and their teammates. What You’ll Do • Build automation systems that handle complex insurance servicing tasks end-to-end (policy endorsements, cancellations, document uploads, reinstatements) or reduce policy cancellations, improve renewals, and ensure users always have the best coverage. • Fast sprint cycles: ship new automations in 1–2 weeks on average. • Compose backend business logic that drives automation while respecting complex insurance carrier rules. • Design backend pipelines that sync customer policy data, deliver timely alerts, and power seamless re-shopping experiences. • Optimize and scale our internal tools (think: in-house DocuSign for servicing) to reduce agent intervention to nearly zero. • Collaborate closely with product, data, and engineering ops to anticipate churn and improve customer retention. • Work asynchronously across time zones, with minimal meetings but strong collaboration through Asana and Slack. • Continuously improve our backend systems, APIs, and microservice architecture. What We’re Looking For • Experience: At least 2 years full stack engineering experience building production-grade software, ideally prior experience building large scale distributed systems for a fast-growing consumer-facing software. • Tech stack: Strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and systems design matter more than having previous experience with specific languages or frameworks. • Problem solver: You enjoy tackling ambiguous problems, breaking them down into actionable code, and iterating quickly. • Ownership: You take responsibility for end-to-end outcomes and continuously improve the systems you build. • Collaboration: Comfortable working asynchronously across teams and time zones, with excellent communication skills. • Curiosity + adaptability: You love learning, exploring new tools, and stepping outside your comfort zone to understand the bigger picture. Our stack • Frontend & backend: TypeScript, Nest.js, Next.js, React, React Native, Expo • API: GraphQL • Data: Postgres, DynamoDB, Clickhouse, Redis • Infrastructure: AWS, microservices, containerized services on ECS/EKS, asynchronous processing on Lambda Why Jerry? This isn’t just another coding job — you’ll be solving real-world problems at scale, helping millions of people manage their most expensive (or at least second most expensive) asset more effortlessly. You’ll work in a flexible, fast-moving, and highly collaborative culture, where innovation is encouraged, your voice is heard, and the impact of your work is immediate. You’ll tackle meaningful challenges, learn constantly, and grow alongside extremely talented engineers. 🚀 If this sounds like your kind of place, we want to meet you!

BrandBoosty is developing an intelligent \"Agency Operating System,\" and we need a logical thinker who loves figuring out how things work. You will work directly with the founder to bridge the gap between Business Logic (our pricing models) and Technical Implementation (Python, JSON, AI Tools). If you spend your free time watching YouTube videos about new AI tools, or if you love organizing messy data into clean systems, this role is for you. Key Responsibilities • System Logic & Architecture: Help us structure our backend data (using JSON/Python) so that our pricing and packages make logical sense for the computer. • AI Tool Exploration: Be our \"Chief Explorer.\" Test new AI tools (Google Gemini, ChatGPT, Antigravity) and figure out how we can use them to automate boring tasks. • Web Development: Implement the website and portal, focusing on functionality and user flow. • Vendor & Server Liaison: Help communicate with technical vendors (software providers) and assist with basic server/cloud configurations. • Prompt Engineering: Write and refine prompts to get the best code and content out of our AI models.

You are excited about the future of AI. • You Are a Self-Learner: If you don't know how to use a specific API or Server tool, your first instinct is to Google it, watch a tutorial, and figure it out. • You Are Detail-Oriented: You notice when a comma is missing in a line of code or when a price doesn't add up. Requirements • Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, IT, Data Science, or related field. • Strong Logical Thinking skills (ability to map out workflows). • Basic to Intermediate knowledge of Python (for scripting/data). • Familiarity with JSON structures. • Experience with AI Tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude). • Basic understanding of how servers, domains, and APIs work.

You proactively seek out bugs and fix them. Occasionally, when bugs find you, you don't sweep them under the rug. • You are experienced with software estimation, often confronted with complexity and uncertainty. • You make decisions based on data. You are versed with tools to measure every aspect of the application. • You have developed large applications in a team environment. • You are not afraid of changes. Armed with excellent refactoring techniques, you work effectively with legacy code. • You are a good communicator. You can present complicated solutions to non-technical audience in a simple and logical way. How You’ll Succeed: At Loblaw Digital, we seek great people to continually strengthen our culture.
