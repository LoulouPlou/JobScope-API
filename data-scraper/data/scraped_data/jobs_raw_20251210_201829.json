    "description": "In most companies, traditional customer support is often plagued by inefficiency and mediocrity. Support engineers frequently waste time on repetitive tasks or struggle with problems outside their narrow expertise. Data shows that over 60% of tickets get escalated because the first line of defense lacks the skills or knowledge to resolve them.\n\nAt Trilogy, we don’t do traditional. Managing over 100 enterprise software products, we’ve redefined customer support with advanced AI. Most issues are handled by our AI-powered chatbot, leaving only the most complex challenges for our engineers. That means every ticket you touch is difficult, varied, and requires creative problem-solving.\n\nIn this role, there’s no time for hand-holding or “learning the ropes” at a leisurely pace. If you need constant guidance, struggle to self-learn, or tend to ask obvious questions, you won’t last two weeks. Success requires a proactive mindset, the ability to adapt quickly, and the drive to figure things out independently.\n\nIf you’re ready to step up and tackle the toughest problems in customer support, this role will accelerate your growth like nothing else. You’ll gain unparalleled technical expertise across a massive product portfolio while contributing directly to Trilogy’s reputation for excellence. If you are up to the task of pushing your limits, we’d love to see you apply.\n\nWhat you will be doing\n• AI-Augmented Customer Resolutions: Analyze complex tickets escalated by AI systems, apply human expertise to areas where AI falls short, and then close the gap by improving the AI system\n\nWhat you won’t be doing\n• Taking two whole months to get up to speed; you will be expected to ramp up one several products within the first month (we are aware this is aggressive)\n• Relying on your managers for help; if you are not adept at unblocking yourself, you will likely struggle in this role\n\nL2 Customer Support Engineer key responsibilities\n• Integrate technical human expertise and AI capabilities to deliver exceptional customer support, focusing on complex issues that AI cannot yet fully resolve\n\nBasic Requirements\n• At least 3 total years of experience in a technical customer support role\n• Advanced generative AI proficiency (i.e., use of multiple AI tools, ability to automate workflows and custom GPTs); if you've only used LLMs for research, learning, brainstorming, or content generation, that will be deemed insufficient\n\nAbout Trilogy\n\nHundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses. Our technological innovation is spearheaded by a passion for simple customer-facing designs. Our incubation of new businesses ranges from entirely new moon-shot ideas to rearchitecting existing projects for today's modern cloud-based stack. Trilogy is a place where you can be surrounded with great people, be proud of doing great work, and grow your career by leaps and bounds.",

Every movie, game, and live event is brought to life by the creativity, dedication, and passion of our team. With 156 theatres, over 1,600 screens, and approximately 73% of the Canadian box office, we are proud to be a leading force in Canadian entertainment. Our inclusive and collaborative culture makes room for your voice, your ambitions, and your life outside of work, so you can build a career that feels as rewarding personally as it is professionally.\n\nIf you are ready to make your mark in an environment where your contributions matter and your growth is celebrated, your next great role is waiting at Cineplex.\n\nWho we need\n\nReporting to the Manager, Software Development, we are looking for a Senior Front End Developer to join the Theatrical squad at Cineplex.

You will work on consumer-scale applications that require performance optimization, security, accessibility compliance, and seamless integration across devices. Your work will be seen and used every day by millions of Canadians. From browsing cineplex.com to ordering concessions ahead of time, you will build features that directly shape customer experiences in real-time.\n\nAutonomy and ownership. You will have the freedom to influence design patterns, architectural decisions, and coding standards. You will partner with technical leads, architects, and product stakeholders, gaining visibility into decision-making at multiple levels. You will be trusted to make technical calls, mentor junior developers, and lead proof-of-concept work with new tools and frameworks.\n\nTechnical growth. You will continuously sharpen your skills in React, Next.js, TypeScript, and accessibility, while also experimenting with AI development assistants like GitHub Copilot and 365 Copilot. You will be part of a culture that encourages adopting new technologies, modernizing legacy systems, and pushing forward development practices.\n\nCareer development. You will join a team that values innovation and encourages experimentation. As a senior member, you will have opportunities to mentor others, work on proof-of-concepts, and explore new tools and frameworks. You will be supported in growing into a technical leader who can influence practices across squads while continuously developing your own skills.\n\nWhat you will do\n• Design and develop. You will build, enhance, and optimize consumer-facing applications using React, Next.js, TypeScript, HTML, and SASS. You will develop and maintain component libraries and ensure solutions are performant, secure, and scalable.\n• Champion best practices. You will shape coding standards, influence architectural decisions, and bring forward innovative approaches to modernizing front-end development at Cineplex.\n• Ensure quality and accessibility. You will test and debug applications, perform root cause analysis, and apply WCAG 2.1+ standards using accessibility tools such as Axe, Lighthouse, WAVE, NVDA, and JAWS to ensure inclusive user experiences.\n• Collaborate and mentor. You will work closely with designers, product managers, backend developers, and QA to deliver high-quality features. You will mentor junior developers through code reviews, pair programming, and knowledge sharing.\n• Innovate with tools. You will leverage AI-assisted development tools such as GitHub Copilot to accelerate workflows, improve code quality, and explore proof-of-concept initiatives.\n\nWhat you bring\n• The technical expertise. You have recent, hands-on experience with React, Next.js, and TypeScript, supported by a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and SASS. You are experienced with REST APIs, Git, and Agile development practices. You bring knowledge of accessibility standards and tools, and you may also have exposure to Node.js, ASP.NET MVC, or project tracking tools such as Azure DevOps or Jira.\n• The experience. You have contributed to large-scale, consumer-facing applications and understand the demands of delivering at a national scale. You are comfortable working with component libraries, performance optimization, and modern web architectures.\n• The ownership. You hold yourself accountable for quality, performance, and timelines. You thrive when you are empowered to make technical decisions, influence best practices, and drive improvements that impact both the product and the team.\n• The collaborative approach. You have strong written and verbal communication skills. You can explain technical concepts to different audiences, ask thoughtful questions to clarify direction, and contribute to a culture of shared learning and continuous improvement.\n\nWhy build your career at Cineplex?
