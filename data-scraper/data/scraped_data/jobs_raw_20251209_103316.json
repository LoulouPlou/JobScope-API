    "description": "In most companies, traditional customer support is often plagued by inefficiency and mediocrity. Support engineers frequently waste time on repetitive tasks or struggle with problems outside their narrow expertise. Data shows that over 60% of tickets get escalated because the first line of defense lacks the skills or knowledge to resolve them.\n\nAt Trilogy, we don’t do traditional. Managing over 100 enterprise software products, we’ve redefined customer support with advanced AI. Most issues are handled by our AI-powered chatbot, leaving only the most complex challenges for our engineers. That means every ticket you touch is difficult, varied, and requires creative problem-solving.\n\nIn this role, there’s no time for hand-holding or “learning the ropes” at a leisurely pace. If you need constant guidance, struggle to self-learn, or tend to ask obvious questions, you won’t last two weeks. Success requires a proactive mindset, the ability to adapt quickly, and the drive to figure things out independently.\n\nIf you’re ready to step up and tackle the toughest problems in customer support, this role will accelerate your growth like nothing else. You’ll gain unparalleled technical expertise across a massive product portfolio while contributing directly to Trilogy’s reputation for excellence. If you are up to the task of pushing your limits, we’d love to see you apply.\n\nWhat you will be doing\n• AI-Augmented Customer Resolutions: Analyze complex tickets escalated by AI systems, apply human expertise to areas where AI falls short, and then close the gap by improving the AI system\n\nWhat you won’t be doing\n• Taking two whole months to get up to speed; you will be expected to ramp up one several products within the first month (we are aware this is aggressive)\n• Relying on your managers for help; if you are not adept at unblocking yourself, you will likely struggle in this role\n\nL2 Customer Support Engineer key responsibilities\n• Integrate technical human expertise and AI capabilities to deliver exceptional customer support, focusing on complex issues that AI cannot yet fully resolve\n\nBasic Requirements\n• At least 3 total years of experience in a technical customer support role\n• Advanced generative AI proficiency (i.e., use of multiple AI tools, ability to automate workflows and custom GPTs); if you've only used LLMs for research, learning, brainstorming, or content generation, that will be deemed insufficient\n\nAbout Trilogy\n\nHundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses. Our technological innovation is spearheaded by a passion for simple customer-facing designs. Our incubation of new businesses ranges from entirely new moon-shot ideas to rearchitecting existing projects for today's modern cloud-based stack. Trilogy is a place where you can be surrounded with great people, be proud of doing great work, and grow your career by leaps and bounds.",

    "description": "161 Bay Street (93021), Canada, Toronto,Toronto, Ontario,\n\nSenior Associate, Data Analyst\n\nOur Capital One DA Team.\n\nData is at the center of everything we do. It started in 1988, when we launched as a startup with the goal of using data to deliver personalized credit card products. Fast-forward a few years — we’re a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.\n\nAs a Data Analyst on our team, you’ll be curious enough to ask questions and brave enough to blurt out a cool idea. You approach problems with creativity, and you love exploring new ways of doing things. But most importantly, you enjoy collaborating, and you’re always willing to share your knowledge with your peers — because you know that’s how the best ideas are made.\n\nWorking with us\n\nHow do we do things at Capital One Canada? We listen — to our people, and to our customers. We change with the times and have adopted a flexible hybrid model. A flexible hybrid working model is one that creates the opportunity to match the work that we do to the environment that best supports that work. Associates working in the hybrid model are expected to come into the office 3 days a week across Tuesdays and Thursdays, reserving Mondays and Fridays as company-wide virtual days. As was true before the pandemic, expectations of being in the office will be balanced with personal life flexibility.​\n\nAt Capital One we’re committed to diversity, inclusion and belonging. We strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and inclusive behaviours are embedded in everything we do to positively impact associates. Strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and to help challenge the status quo and create the best outcomes for everyone.\n\nWe’re focused on helping associates live well—physically, financially and emotionally. When you join us, we support you and those who are most important to you, offering full coverage for spouses, domestic partners, and dependents. We’ve designed our benefits program to be flexible, comprehensive and consistent across our organization. From health and fitness center discounts, to training and professional development programs—and much more—you’ll discover that Capital One is committed to helping you live your best life.\n\nHere are some examples of projects that you may work on as a Senior Data Analyst:\n• Build, automate, and maintain critical business reporting using cutting-edge tools.\n• Write SQL to clean, transform, investigate, and augment large, complex database tables\n• Work closely with business partners to make sure our business strategy is as data driven as possible\n• Design and implement rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas to customers or company leaders\n• Ensure data and intent integrity by automating data quality verification\n• Support and consult with the business to propagate data management best practices\n• Create and maintain well-managed critical data processes to meet regulatory requirements.\n• Identify process improvements and deliver on them.\n• Perform ad hoc analytics on large/diverse datasets.\n\nWe want you to be one of us if you are:\n• Curious: You ask why, you explore, and you’re not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You know SQL and are constantly exploring new open source tools, and hitting up stack overflow on a regular basis.\n• A Wrangler: You know how to programmatically extract data from a database or an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and convert into a human-readable form (Matplotlib, QuickSight, Tableau, etc.).\n• Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.\n• Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.\n• Collaborative: You’re able to work with teammates with diverse skill sets and explain your work to less technical audiences.\n\nBasic Qualifications:\n• Bachelor's Degree\n• At least 2 years of experience with SQL\n• At least 1 year of experience with Unix or equivalent\n• At least 1 year of experience with version control systems like GitHub.\n\nPreferred Qualifications:\n• Master's Degree\n• Experience working with AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, etc.)\n• Experience working with advanced Git Workflows (Pull Requests, Code Reviews, Issues, and Branching)\n• At least 1 year of experience in open source programming languages for large scale data analysis (Python or equivalent)\n• At least 3 years’ experience with SQL\n\nCapital One Canada is an equal opportunity employer committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment.

    "description": "Creative Market is the world’s preferred one-stop shop for the creator community - a platform where creators from across the globe buy and sell digital, high-quality design assets. We’re passionate about building tools and experiences that make design beautiful, effective, and accessible to everyone.\n\nWith many jobs, you have to pick between having a huge impact on the organization (small team) or having a huge impact on the world (big product), but at Creative Market - you get to do both! You get to work on a digital asset marketplace, as part of a fully remote team, that has more than 30 million quality resources created by artists in 148 countries around the world.\n\nAt Creative Market, we serve a global community and we need a diverse team to do that successfully. Women; people of colour; members of the LGBTQ+ community; and people of all backgrounds, religions, gender identities, individuals with disabilities, and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply. We provide an accessible candidate experience, and if you need any accommodations or adjustments throughout the interview process and beyond, please let us know. We’re dedicated to fostering an inclusive and diverse environment for employees from all walks of life.\n\nWe’re building a fully remote team across Canada and the United States. We believe that creative collaboration can happen anywhere, and that working remotely shouldn’t have to mean sacrificing a sense of cohesion, community, and connection. We’ve seen that by combining thoughtful collaboration, frequent communication, and the freedom for people to be their authentic selves, you can do your best work and inspire others to do the same.\n\nAbout the role:\n\nWe’re looking for a Senior Analytics Engineer to help build and evolve Creative Market’s data platform, using tools from the modern data stack such as dbt, Snowflake, Metabase, Dagster, and Amplitude. At Creative Market, our data function exists to provide accurate, timely, and insightful reporting to stakeholders throughout the organization, as well as create value through various data science initiatives.\n\nAs a Senior Analytics Engineer, you’ll play a pivotal role in shaping our data-driven decision-making process and provide advanced insights to drive business growth and innovation. Reporting to our VP of Product, you’ll lead initiatives to leverage data for strategic recommendations and collaborate across teams to enhance our data platform. This role offers a unique opportunity to take ownership of our analytics function and drive its evolution!\n\nYou will further build our self-serve data platform by following software engineering best practices such as version control and continuous integration - developing intuitive, tested, and documented data models, and creating reliable dashboards.\n\nWorking with our Engineering team, you'll help to define tracking requirements and ensure we have access to the data we need for impactful insights. You'll also collaborate frequently with Product, Marketing, Sales, and our leadership team to transform data into meaningful stories that guide confident, informed decisions!\n\nAs a Senior Analytics Engineer, you’ll be responsible for:\n• Leading efforts to define and build success metrics for Marketing and Product programs and campaigns that drive meaningful growth.\n• Delivering well-defined, transformed, tested, documented, and code-reviewed datasets that enable confident decision making.\n• Proactively analyzing data and insights, and communicating clear opportunities to stakeholders to drive performance. This is not a passive reporting role.\n• Working with Product Managers to analyze customer trends and product performance to improve company OKRs.\n• Conducting exploratory analysis to uncover new areas of opportunity, generate hypotheses, and quickly assess and clearly communicate the potential upside of a given opportunity. This person will make recommendations based on findings to drive quality business decisions.\n• Managing the integration of tracking requirements for new products and features, and collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to ensure accurate data capture.\n• Identifying and integrating valuable data sources using ETL tools (e.g. Fivetran, Stitch) or custom pipelines in Python (we use Dagster).\n• Collaborating with research and engineering teams to improve data models that feed business intelligence tools, increase data accessibility, and foster data-driven decision making across the organization.\n• Implementing processes and systems to monitor data quality, ensuring production data is always accurate and available for key stakeholders that depend on it.\n• Developing and maintaining scalable data pipelines and building out new API integrations to support growth in data volume and complexity.\n• Defining and maintaining clear data documentation, definitions, and governance to ensure consistency across metrics like MAU and MRR.\n• Translating analytical findings into strategic recommendations that drive product enhancements, customer satisfaction, and revenue growth.\n\nWe believe it’s important for you to have:\n• 5+ years of experience in data analysis or analytics engineering roles with a progressive increase in responsibility.\n• Advanced proficiency in SQL. You have experience querying large and complex datasets efficiently and structuring queries that are both performant and easy to understand. Experience with dbt and building well-structured DAGs of data models is a strong plus!\n• Proficiency with Metabase or a similar BI tool.\n• Proven data wrangling and modeling skills. You can clean, transform, and enrich even the messiest data, structuring it to facilitate accurate and scalable analysis.\n• Proficiency in Python. You’re comfortable writing tested, version-controlled programs (we use Git), and ideally have experience with ETL tools or orchestration frameworks such as Dagster.\n• Experience with cloud data platforms and scalable data architecture. You're comfortable working with data in cloud environments (e.g., Snowflake) and designing pipelines and models that can scale with growing data volume and complexity.\n• Experience with Amplitude and Terraform is helpful, but not essential!\n• Excellent problem-solving abilities. You have a track record of developing creative and effective solutions to complex analytical challenges.\n• Strong communication skills. You can translate complex technical insights into clear, compelling narratives for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\n• Natural collaboration and organizational skills. You work effectively across teams, manage multiple priorities, and take initiative to lead data-driven projects from concept to impact.\n• Expertise in data mining and analysis methods. You’re skilled at uncovering insights that drive product innovation and business growth.\n\nCompensation:\n\nCreative Market believes that what keeps people happy at a company isn't just salary, but rather being given fulfilling and purposeful work, along with opportunities to learn and grow. We aim to provide both opportunities to grow professionally and in earning potential. At the time of this posting, and in good faith, we expect to pay this role a salary between $110,000 - $130,000 CAD annually.

We understand that compensation extends beyond salary. Our benefits package (listed below) was designed with intention, to ensure that our teams are being supported holistically. We empower our people to lead healthy, fulfilled lives both at and away from work.\n\nBenefits\n\nAt Creative Market, you’ll join a diverse team dedicated to learning, teaching, and growing; as individuals, as a team, as a business, and as a community. As a workplace, we pride ourselves on doing right by our employees, and have a benefits package that makes being a part of the team a dream job and something to be really proud of.\n• 100% remote: so you can work where you feel most comfortable and inspired.\n• Stay healthy: generous medical and dental for both you and your dependents.\n• Relax and unwind: with plenty of paid vacation, and paid sick time for when you need it.\n• Paid volunteer days: for you to spend giving back to nonprofits/organizations that are important to you.\n• Celebrate: we observe both US and Canadian holidays - and a whole week of rest in December.\n• Family leave: paid time off for when your family grows.\n• Save up: put pre-tax savings into a 401k/RRSP - we’ll match a portion of your contributions.\n• Fitness fund: to help you feel your very best.\n• Equipment fund: so you can deck out your home office.\n• Monthly coffee budget: grab that latte - it’s on us.\n• Learning and development: keep growing with paid courses, books, and conferences.\n• Hang out: spend time together with your team virtually or in-person through culture events, monthly yoga, socials, and more.\n• Pro tools: MacBook Pro (or Air) and all the tools you need to do a great job.",

We’re training and deploying frontier models for developers and enterprises who are building AI systems to power magical experiences like content generation, semantic search, RAG, and agents. We believe that our work is instrumental to the widespread adoption of AI.\n\nWe obsess over what we build. Each one of us is responsible for contributing to increasing the capabilities of our models and the value they drive for our customers. We like to work hard and move fast to do what’s best for our customers.\n\nCohere is a team of researchers, engineers, designers, and more, who are passionate about their craft. Each person is one of the best in the world at what they do. We believe that a diverse range of perspectives is a requirement for building great products.\n\nJoin us on our mission and shape the future!\n\nAbout the Native team\n\nOn this product team, you will be responsible for bringing North to iOS and Android, translating our web experience into native-first interfaces that feel at home on mobile platforms. You'll help define the vision for North Native, determining what to adapt, what to reimagine, and what new capabilities mobile unlocks. This role requires fluency in both web and native design patterns, understanding when to maintain consistency with our existing experience and when platform conventions should take precedence. You'll be shaping the early product experience and design patterns that will serve as the foundation of North Native.\n\nIn this role, you will:\n• Own the design process end-to-end for Native experiences. Collaborate with Product on the mobile product vision and translate complex web workflows into intuitive native experiences optimized for iOS and Android.\n• Balance consistency with our web platform against native platform conventions, making thoughtful decisions about when to align and when to diverge based on user context and platform strengths.\n• Design with platform-specific patterns and capabilities in mind—leveraging native gestures, notifications, widgets, and system integrations to create experiences that feel truly native.\n• Partner closely with product managers and engineers throughout the development lifecycle, collaborating on technical feasibility, implementation details, and platform-specific constraints.\n• Conduct user research to understand mobile-specific use cases, behaviours, and expectations, ensuring Native delivers unique value rather than simply replicating the web experience.\n• Establish design patterns and guidelines for Native that scale across both platforms while accommodating platform-specific needs and future mobile capabilities.\n\nYou're likely a good fit if you have:\n• Product Design Experience: 3+ years designing digital products with a strong portfolio that demonstrates your process, systems thinking, and measurable impact on user outcomes.\n• Cross-Functional Partnership: A collaborative approach to product development—working closely with Product Managers to identify opportunities, with Engineers to navigate technical constraints and review implementations, and with stakeholders across the organization to align on solutions.\n• User-Centered Approach: A deep commitment to understanding user needs through research and direct engagement. You drive research initiatives, translate findings into design decisions, and stay informed on industry trends and AI developments that shape the product landscape.\n• Craft Excellence: Meticulous attention to craft and detail. You're proficient in Figma, build scalable component systems, and consistently elevate the quality of everything you touch. Bonus points for strong visual design skills in typography, layout, color, and composition.\n• Communication Skills: Clear, proactive communication that keeps distributed teams aligned. You document decisions, articulate design rationale to diverse audiences, and create shared understanding across geographies and disciplines.\n\nIf some of the above doesn’t line up perfectly with your experience, we still encourage you to apply!\n\nWe value and celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive work environment for all. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and are committed to providing equal opportunities. Should you require any accommodations during the recruitment process, please submit an Accommodations Request Form, and we will work together to meet your needs.\n\nFull-Time Employees at Cohere enjoy these Perks:\n\n🤝 An open and inclusive culture and work environment\n\n🧑‍💻 Work closely with a team on the cutting edge of AI research\n\n🍽 Weekly lunch stipend, in-office lunches & snacks\n\n🦷 Full health and dental benefits, including a separate budget to take care of your mental health\n\n🐣 100% Parental Leave top-up for up to 6 months\n\n🎨 Personal enrichment benefits towards arts and culture, fitness and well-being, quality time, and workspace improvement\n\n🏙 Remote-flexible, offices in Toronto, New York, San Francisco, London and Paris, as well as a co-working stipend\n\n✈️ 6 weeks of vacation (30 working days!)",

We understand that a resume can only showcase so much during the applicant stage, so we've created prompts in the application for you to share more about yourself. If you've made a career transition (or a few!), you’re self taught in a new role, or you have skills/experience you’d like to highlight, we want to hear more about what you could bring to the table.\n\nAI in Recruitment 👩🏻‍💻 At Loopio, we leverage artificial intelligence (AI) technology to enhance our recruitment process.

We are committed to the responsible use of AI in our hiring practices, prioritizing both an improved candidate experience and operational efficiency. Our standardized hiring practices remain focused on reducing biases, with all key hiring decisions solely made by our team. We continuously review and refine our hiring practices to align with industry best practices and evolving legal guidelines\n\nLoopio is an equal opportunity employer that is deeply committed to building equitable workplaces that are diverse and inclusive.

    "description": "About Thri5\n\nThri5 is the AI-powered System of Actions for the modern retailer.\n\nDespite massive investments in planning, forecasting, and analytics, retailers still face the same operational issuesout-of-stocks, bad master data, margin leakage, and inconsistent execution across stores and channels. The gap isn't in intelligence; it's in execution.\n\nThri5 continually scans data across the business, detects and prioritizes opportunities, evaluates impact, and orchestrates execution through both humans and AI agents. From store managers and DC leaders to category and supply chain teams, Thri5 routes the right actions to the right ownerswith clear context, recommendations, and workflowsclosing the gap between plan and real-world performance.\n\nOur vision is to become the trusted AI operating layer for retail execution, making every operator 10x more effective and freeing them to focus on what matters most: serving customers and growing the business.\n\nFounded by a team with deep retail and retail-technology experience, Thri5 is venture-backed by some of Canada's most prominent VC and angel investors.\n\nYour Role\n\nAs an AI / Machine Learning Engineer at Thri5, you'll help build the agent layer that powers our System of Actions. You'll design and implement multi-agent Co-pilot systems that orchestrate complex workflows, call tools and APIs, and automate operational tasks at scale. You'll also develop deterministic, data-driven detection models to reliably identify operational issues and opportunitiesand then layer LLM-based capabilities on top to generate high-quality alerts, recommended actions, and explanations grounded in real retail data.\n\nYou'll work closely with the founding team to turn messy, real-world retail problems into robust, production agent workflows that operators actually trust and use every day.\n\nKey Responsibilities\n\nAgent Framework & Orchestration\n• Design and build the core frameworks that power Thri5's AI agents: task decomposition, routing, tool calling, multi-step workflows, and human-in-the-loop escalation.\n• Implement agents that coordinate across operators (store, DC, category, supply chain) and systems to drive real actions, not just insights.\n\nLLM-Driven Intelligence\n• Develop and fine-tune LLM-based components to detect anomalies and opportunities that impact commercial and operational performance.\n• Build prompt, retrieval, and grounding patterns that produce reliable behaviour in noisy, real-world data.\n• Combine deterministic signals with LLMs to produce contextual narratives, explanations, and recommended actions.\n\nDeterministic Detection & Scoring\n• Design and implement deterministic and semi-deterministic detection models (e.g., statistical anomaly detection, rules + ML hybrids, scoring systems) to identify out-of-stocks, bad master data, and execution gaps.\n• Build evaluation frameworks (precision/recall, false positive control, business impact, backtests) to ensure detections are trustworthy and stable in production.\n• Collaborate with product and domain experts to translate heuristics and business rules into robust, maintainable detection logic.\n\nData & Recommendation Pipelines\n• Build and optimize pipelines that leverage real-time and batch customer data (transactions, inventory, operations) to power agent decisions and recommendations.\n• Own end-to-end ML workflowsdata preprocessing, feature engineering, training, evaluation, and production inference.\n\nMLOps / LLMOps & Reliability\n• Implement robust MLOps practices for CI/CD, experimentation, and monitoring of models and agents.\n• Instrument and monitor agent behaviour (latency, cost, quality, safety) and continuously iterate to improve performance, accuracy, and scalability.\n\nCollaboration & Product\n• Partner with product and engineering to translate customer problems into concrete agent capabilities and use cases.\n• Contribute to technical decision-making and architecture as we scale the Thri5 platform.\n\nRequirements\n• AI Fluency: 5+ years of software development experience with deep exposure to modern AI/ML, including both classical ML / data science and LLMs, GPT-style models, and agent/tool-calling ecosystems.\n• ML / Data Science Proficiency: Strong background in supervised/unsupervised learning and anomaly detection, with hands-on experience designing deterministic or semi-deterministic detection systems (statistical models, rules + ML, scoring). Comfortable with model evaluation, experimentation, and translating business heuristics into data-driven logic.\n• Programming & Frameworks: Proficient in Python and familiar with ML frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. Experience with GenAI tooling (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, custom agent frameworks) and vector databases is an asset.\n• Data Handling: Comfortable working with large-scale datasets, complex schemas, and event-driven data. Strong SQL skills and experience building data pipelines into production systems.\n• Startup Mindset: Thrive in a fast-paced, ambiguous environment; able to bring structure to open-ended problems. Enjoy high accountability and end-to-end ownership from idea to production impact.\n• Teamwork: Collaborative, low-ego, and comfortable working across a small, high-performing team (founders, engineers, product, and customers).\n• Domain Experience (Nice to Have): Experience in retail, supply chain, predictive analytics, time-series modeling, or operational optimization.\n• Education: Bachelor's, Master's or Ph.D. in Computer Science, Data Science, Machine Learning, or a related field (or equivalent practical experience).",
