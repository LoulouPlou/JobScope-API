    "description": "In most companies, traditional customer support is often plagued by inefficiency and mediocrity. Support engineers frequently waste time on repetitive tasks or struggle with problems outside their narrow expertise. Data shows that over 60% of tickets get escalated because the first line of defense lacks the skills or knowledge to resolve them. At Trilogy, we don’t do traditional. Managing over 100 enterprise software products, we’ve redefined customer support with advanced AI. Most issues are handled by our AI-powered chatbot, leaving only the most complex challenges for our engineers. That means every ticket you touch is difficult, varied, and requires creative problem-solving. In this role, there’s no time for hand-holding or “learning the ropes” at a leisurely pace. If you need constant guidance, struggle to self-learn, or tend to ask obvious questions, you won’t last two weeks. Success requires a proactive mindset, the ability to adapt quickly, and the drive to figure things out independently. If you’re ready to step up and tackle the toughest problems in customer support, this role will accelerate your growth like nothing else. You’ll gain unparalleled technical expertise across a massive product portfolio while contributing directly to Trilogy’s reputation for excellence. If you are up to the task of pushing your limits, we’d love to see you apply. What you will be doing • AI-Augmented Customer Resolutions: Analyze complex tickets escalated by AI systems, apply human expertise to areas where AI falls short, and then close the gap by improving the AI system What you won’t be doing • Taking two whole months to get up to speed; you will be expected to ramp up one several products within the first month (we are aware this is aggressive) • Relying on your managers for help; if you are not adept at unblocking yourself, you will likely struggle in this role L2 Customer Support Engineer key responsibilities • Integrate technical human expertise and AI capabilities to deliver exceptional customer support, focusing on complex issues that AI cannot yet fully resolve Basic Requirements • At least 3 total years of experience in a technical customer support role • Advanced generative AI proficiency (i.e., use of multiple AI tools, ability to automate workflows and custom GPTs); if you've only used LLMs for research, learning, brainstorming, or content generation, that will be deemed insufficient About Trilogy Hundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses. Our technological innovation is spearheaded by a passion for simple customer-facing designs. Our incubation of new businesses ranges from entirely new moon-shot ideas to rearchitecting existing projects for today's modern cloud-based stack. Trilogy is a place where you can be surrounded with great people, be proud of doing great work, and grow your career by leaps and bounds.",

We’re training and deploying frontier models for developers and enterprises who are building AI systems to power magical experiences like content generation, semantic search, RAG, and agents. We believe that our work is instrumental to the widespread adoption of AI. We obsess over what we build. Each one of us is responsible for contributing to increasing the capabilities of our models and the value they drive for our customers. We like to work hard and move fast to do what’s best for our customers. Cohere is a team of researchers, engineers, designers, and more, who are passionate about their craft. Each person is one of the best in the world at what they do. We believe that a diverse range of perspectives is a requirement for building great products. Join us on our mission and shape the future! About the Native team On this product team, you will be responsible for bringing North to iOS and Android, translating our web experience into native-first interfaces that feel at home on mobile platforms. You'll help define the vision for North Native, determining what to adapt, what to reimagine, and what new capabilities mobile unlocks. This role requires fluency in both web and native design patterns, understanding when to maintain consistency with our existing experience and when platform conventions should take precedence. You'll be shaping the early product experience and design patterns that will serve as the foundation of North Native. In this role, you will: • Own the design process end-to-end for Native experiences. Collaborate with Product on the mobile product vision and translate complex web workflows into intuitive native experiences optimized for iOS and Android. • Balance consistency with our web platform against native platform conventions, making thoughtful decisions about when to align and when to diverge based on user context and platform strengths. • Design with platform-specific patterns and capabilities in mind—leveraging native gestures, notifications, widgets, and system integrations to create experiences that feel truly native. • Partner closely with product managers and engineers throughout the development lifecycle, collaborating on technical feasibility, implementation details, and platform-specific constraints. • Conduct user research to understand mobile-specific use cases, behaviours, and expectations, ensuring Native delivers unique value rather than simply replicating the web experience. • Establish design patterns and guidelines for Native that scale across both platforms while accommodating platform-specific needs and future mobile capabilities. You're likely a good fit if you have: • Product Design Experience: 3+ years designing digital products with a strong portfolio that demonstrates your process, systems thinking, and measurable impact on user outcomes. • Cross-Functional Partnership: A collaborative approach to product development—working closely with Product Managers to identify opportunities, with Engineers to navigate technical constraints and review implementations, and with stakeholders across the organization to align on solutions. • User-Centered Approach: A deep commitment to understanding user needs through research and direct engagement. You drive research initiatives, translate findings into design decisions, and stay informed on industry trends and AI developments that shape the product landscape. • Craft Excellence: Meticulous attention to craft and detail. You're proficient in Figma, build scalable component systems, and consistently elevate the quality of everything you touch. Bonus points for strong visual design skills in typography, layout, color, and composition. • Communication Skills: Clear, proactive communication that keeps distributed teams aligned. You document decisions, articulate design rationale to diverse audiences, and create shared understanding across geographies and disciplines. If some of the above doesn’t line up perfectly with your experience, we still encourage you to apply! We value and celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive work environment for all. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and are committed to providing equal opportunities. Should you require any accommodations during the recruitment process, please submit an Accommodations Request Form, and we will work together to meet your needs. Full-Time Employees at Cohere enjoy these Perks: 🤝 An open and inclusive culture and work environment 🧑‍💻 Work closely with a team on the cutting edge of AI research 🍽 Weekly lunch stipend, in-office lunches & snacks 🦷 Full health and dental benefits, including a separate budget to take care of your mental health 🐣 100% Parental Leave top-up for up to 6 months 🎨 Personal enrichment benefits towards arts and culture, fitness and well-being, quality time, and workspace improvement 🏙 Remote-flexible, offices in Toronto, New York, San Francisco, London and Paris, as well as a co-working stipend ✈️ 6 weeks of vacation (30 working days!)",

    "description": "About Thri5 Thri5 is the AI-powered System of Actions for the modern retailer. Despite massive investments in planning, forecasting, and analytics, retailers still face the same operational issuesout-of-stocks, bad master data, margin leakage, and inconsistent execution across stores and channels. The gap isn't in intelligence; it's in execution. Thri5 continually scans data across the business, detects and prioritizes opportunities, evaluates impact, and orchestrates execution through both humans and AI agents. From store managers and DC leaders to category and supply chain teams, Thri5 routes the right actions to the right ownerswith clear context, recommendations, and workflowsclosing the gap between plan and real-world performance. Our vision is to become the trusted AI operating layer for retail execution, making every operator 10x more effective and freeing them to focus on what matters most: serving customers and growing the business. Founded by a team with deep retail and retail-technology experience, Thri5 is venture-backed by some of Canada's most prominent VC and angel investors. Your Role As an AI / Machine Learning Engineer at Thri5, you'll help build the agent layer that powers our System of Actions. You'll design and implement multi-agent Co-pilot systems that orchestrate complex workflows, call tools and APIs, and automate operational tasks at scale. You'll also develop deterministic, data-driven detection models to reliably identify operational issues and opportunitiesand then layer LLM-based capabilities on top to generate high-quality alerts, recommended actions, and explanations grounded in real retail data. You'll work closely with the founding team to turn messy, real-world retail problems into robust, production agent workflows that operators actually trust and use every day. Key Responsibilities Agent Framework & Orchestration • Design and build the core frameworks that power Thri5's AI agents: task decomposition, routing, tool calling, multi-step workflows, and human-in-the-loop escalation. • Implement agents that coordinate across operators (store, DC, category, supply chain) and systems to drive real actions, not just insights. LLM-Driven Intelligence • Develop and fine-tune LLM-based components to detect anomalies and opportunities that impact commercial and operational performance. • Build prompt, retrieval, and grounding patterns that produce reliable behaviour in noisy, real-world data. • Combine deterministic signals with LLMs to produce contextual narratives, explanations, and recommended actions. Deterministic Detection & Scoring • Design and implement deterministic and semi-deterministic detection models (e.g., statistical anomaly detection, rules + ML hybrids, scoring systems) to identify out-of-stocks, bad master data, and execution gaps. • Build evaluation frameworks (precision/recall, false positive control, business impact, backtests) to ensure detections are trustworthy and stable in production. • Collaborate with product and domain experts to translate heuristics and business rules into robust, maintainable detection logic. Data & Recommendation Pipelines • Build and optimize pipelines that leverage real-time and batch customer data (transactions, inventory, operations) to power agent decisions and recommendations. • Own end-to-end ML workflowsdata preprocessing, feature engineering, training, evaluation, and production inference. MLOps / LLMOps & Reliability • Implement robust MLOps practices for CI/CD, experimentation, and monitoring of models and agents. • Instrument and monitor agent behaviour (latency, cost, quality, safety) and continuously iterate to improve performance, accuracy, and scalability. Collaboration & Product • Partner with product and engineering to translate customer problems into concrete agent capabilities and use cases. • Contribute to technical decision-making and architecture as we scale the Thri5 platform. Requirements • AI Fluency: 5+ years of software development experience with deep exposure to modern AI/ML, including both classical ML / data science and LLMs, GPT-style models, and agent/tool-calling ecosystems. • ML / Data Science Proficiency: Strong background in supervised/unsupervised learning and anomaly detection, with hands-on experience designing deterministic or semi-deterministic detection systems (statistical models, rules + ML, scoring). Comfortable with model evaluation, experimentation, and translating business heuristics into data-driven logic. • Programming & Frameworks: Proficient in Python and familiar with ML frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. Experience with GenAI tooling (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, custom agent frameworks) and vector databases is an asset. • Data Handling: Comfortable working with large-scale datasets, complex schemas, and event-driven data. Strong SQL skills and experience building data pipelines into production systems. • Startup Mindset: Thrive in a fast-paced, ambiguous environment; able to bring structure to open-ended problems. Enjoy high accountability and end-to-end ownership from idea to production impact. • Teamwork: Collaborative, low-ego, and comfortable working across a small, high-performing team (founders, engineers, product, and customers). • Domain Experience (Nice to Have): Experience in retail, supply chain, predictive analytics, time-series modeling, or operational optimization. • Education: Bachelor's, Master's or Ph.D. in Computer Science, Data Science, Machine Learning, or a related field (or equivalent practical experience).",
