    "description": "Lead/Staff Software Engineer, AI\n\nAre you ready to shape the future of AI‑driven tax automation? We're looking for a Senior AI Engineer to build and scale intelligent workflows using modern LLM/ML tooling. Your work will directly impact how tax professionals automate complex, high‑stakes processes and access critical information.\n\nYou'll join our Tax and Accounting Professionals 1040 Scan product engineering team and own the design, implementation, and optimization of AI‑powered tax workflows—from data ingestion to production deployment.\n\n1040SCAN is the market-leading scan-and-populate engine in the 1040 workflow, organizing workpapers, extracting data, and exporting to tax software at scale. As a Senior AI engineer, you will modernize the AI that powers document understanding, extraction, and verification—expanding coverage and accuracy while reducing human effort.\n\nAbout the role,\n\nAs a Lead/Staff Software Engineer AI, you will:\n• Advance document intelligence: Build generalizable models for tax documents (standard and non‑standard) using CV/NLP/LLMs and embeddings to move beyond fixed OCR templates with dynamic, context‑aware parsing.\n• Boost auto‑verification & quality: Improve native‑PDF/text‑layer matching, anomaly detection, and prior‑year‑aware checks to catch issues before human review; design human‑in‑the‑loop flows that preserve practitioner control.\n• Scale the pipeline: Productionize low‑latency training/inference pipelines over millions of documents with robust observability, evaluation, and drift monitoring.\n• Integrate LLMs and traditional ML models into robust, auditable workflows that support tax determination, document processing, and rules‑based automation.\n• Build and maintain data pipelines, feature extraction, and preprocessing for tax‑relevant data (e.g., invoices, filings, transactional data).\n• Develop and integrate RESTful APIs / microservices to expose AI capabilities to internal and external systems.\n• Ensure solutions meet compliance, security, and auditability requirements typical of tax and regulated domains.\n• You’ll collaborate across SurePrep engineering and other Thomson Reuters product & engineering teams leveraging TR’s AI platforms including Materia and Additive to deliver reliable, auditable AI in production.\n\nAbout you\n\nYou’re a fit for the role of Lead/Staff Software Engineer, AI if your background includes:\n• 5+ years in applied ML/AI (or 5+ with an advanced degree) delivering production systems in document AI/OCR/NLP or information extraction at scale.\n• Strong Python and deep learning expertise (PyTorch/TensorFlow), with experience in LLMs, embeddings/vector search, prompt design/evaluation, and statistical methods for quality and uncertainty.\n• Cloud‑native ML ops experience: training/inference pipelines, feature/data stores, observability, cost/perf optimization.\n• Own end‑to‑end lifecycle for AI features: design → implementation → testing → deployment → monitoring → iteration.\n• Optimize model/workflow inference for latency, throughput, and cost, including caching, batching, and model selection strategies.\n• Implement monitoring, logging, tracing, and alerting for workflows and models in production (data drift, model performance, error rates).\n• Debug and troubleshoot complex AI systems in production, including prompt failures, integration bugs, and data quality issues.\n• Partner with Product, Tax SMEs, and other engineering teams to translate business/tax requirements into AI workflows.\n• Collaborate with data scientists and ML engineers on model selection, evaluation, and experimentation within Reducto pipelines.\n• Lead design reviews, perform code reviews, and mentor mid‑level/junior engineers on AI best practices and production‑grade coding.\n• Contribute to internal standards, best practices, and templates for building AI workflows with Reducto.\n• You've built end‑to‑end AI features that are running in production, not just prototypes.\n• You can take a vague tax/business requirement and turn it into a concrete, testable workflow design.\n• You care about robustness and correctness as much as cleverness—especially in domains where errors have financial or compliance impact.\n• You're comfortable reading tax/business rules and working with domain experts, even if you're not a tax specialist yourself.\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n• Document AI background: layout parsing, table extraction, doc‑type classification, native‑PDF matching, and verification automation.\n• Agentic/LLM orchestration experience: familiarity with TR AI platforms such as Materia and Additive; retrieval‑augmented and tool‑use patterns; evaluation and guardrails.\n• Modern Development Practices: Hands-on with modern AI coding assistants including Claude Code, Cline, and GitHub Copilot for rapid prototyping, code generation, and workflow automation.\n• Version control: Experience with version control (Git), testing frameworks (pytest or similar), and modern DevOps practices.\n• Software Engineering: Familiarity with C#, Java or any other programming language\n• Domain familiarity: exposure to tax/financial document workflows or other regulated content systems is a plus.\n\n#LI-GK1\n\nWhat’s in it For You?\n• Hybrid Work Model: We’ve adopted a flexible hybrid working environment (2-3 days a week in the office depending on the role) for our office-based roles while delivering a seamless experience that is digitally and physically connected.\n• Flexibility & Work-Life Balance: Flex My Way is a set of supportive workplace policies designed to help manage personal and professional responsibilities, whether caring for family, giving back to the community, or finding time to refresh and reset.

    "description": "About Thri5\n\nThri5 is the AI-powered System of Actions for the modern retailer.\n\nDespite massive investments in planning, forecasting, and analytics, retailers still face the same operational issuesout-of-stocks, bad master data, margin leakage, and inconsistent execution across stores and channels. The gap isn't in intelligence; it's in execution.\n\nThri5 continually scans data across the business, detects and prioritizes opportunities, evaluates impact, and orchestrates execution through both humans and AI agents. From store managers and DC leaders to category and supply chain teams, Thri5 routes the right actions to the right ownerswith clear context, recommendations, and workflowsclosing the gap between plan and real-world performance.\n\nOur vision is to become the trusted AI operating layer for retail execution, making every operator 10x more effective and freeing them to focus on what matters most: serving customers and growing the business.\n\nFounded by a team with deep retail and retail-technology experience, Thri5 is venture-backed by some of Canada's most prominent VC and angel investors.\n\nYour Role\n\nAs an AI / Machine Learning Engineer at Thri5, you'll help build the agent layer that powers our System of Actions. You'll design and implement multi-agent Co-pilot systems that orchestrate complex workflows, call tools and APIs, and automate operational tasks at scale. You'll also develop deterministic, data-driven detection models to reliably identify operational issues and opportunitiesand then layer LLM-based capabilities on top to generate high-quality alerts, recommended actions, and explanations grounded in real retail data.\n\nYou'll work closely with the founding team to turn messy, real-world retail problems into robust, production agent workflows that operators actually trust and use every day.\n\nKey Responsibilities\n\nAgent Framework & Orchestration\n• Design and build the core frameworks that power Thri5's AI agents: task decomposition, routing, tool calling, multi-step workflows, and human-in-the-loop escalation.\n• Implement agents that coordinate across operators (store, DC, category, supply chain) and systems to drive real actions, not just insights.\n\nLLM-Driven Intelligence\n• Develop and fine-tune LLM-based components to detect anomalies and opportunities that impact commercial and operational performance.\n• Build prompt, retrieval, and grounding patterns that produce reliable behaviour in noisy, real-world data.\n• Combine deterministic signals with LLMs to produce contextual narratives, explanations, and recommended actions.\n\nDeterministic Detection & Scoring\n• Design and implement deterministic and semi-deterministic detection models (e.g., statistical anomaly detection, rules + ML hybrids, scoring systems) to identify out-of-stocks, bad master data, and execution gaps.\n• Build evaluation frameworks (precision/recall, false positive control, business impact, backtests) to ensure detections are trustworthy and stable in production.\n• Collaborate with product and domain experts to translate heuristics and business rules into robust, maintainable detection logic.\n\nData & Recommendation Pipelines\n• Build and optimize pipelines that leverage real-time and batch customer data (transactions, inventory, operations) to power agent decisions and recommendations.\n• Own end-to-end ML workflowsdata preprocessing, feature engineering, training, evaluation, and production inference.\n\nMLOps / LLMOps & Reliability\n• Implement robust MLOps practices for CI/CD, experimentation, and monitoring of models and agents.\n• Instrument and monitor agent behaviour (latency, cost, quality, safety) and continuously iterate to improve performance, accuracy, and scalability.\n\nCollaboration & Product\n• Partner with product and engineering to translate customer problems into concrete agent capabilities and use cases.\n• Contribute to technical decision-making and architecture as we scale the Thri5 platform.\n\nRequirements\n• AI Fluency: 5+ years of software development experience with deep exposure to modern AI/ML, including both classical ML / data science and LLMs, GPT-style models, and agent/tool-calling ecosystems.\n• ML / Data Science Proficiency: Strong background in supervised/unsupervised learning and anomaly detection, with hands-on experience designing deterministic or semi-deterministic detection systems (statistical models, rules + ML, scoring). Comfortable with model evaluation, experimentation, and translating business heuristics into data-driven logic.\n• Programming & Frameworks: Proficient in Python and familiar with ML frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. Experience with GenAI tooling (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, custom agent frameworks) and vector databases is an asset.\n• Data Handling: Comfortable working with large-scale datasets, complex schemas, and event-driven data. Strong SQL skills and experience building data pipelines into production systems.\n• Startup Mindset: Thrive in a fast-paced, ambiguous environment; able to bring structure to open-ended problems. Enjoy high accountability and end-to-end ownership from idea to production impact.\n• Teamwork: Collaborative, low-ego, and comfortable working across a small, high-performing team (founders, engineers, product, and customers).\n• Domain Experience (Nice to Have): Experience in retail, supply chain, predictive analytics, time-series modeling, or operational optimization.\n• Education: Bachelor's, Master's or Ph.D. in Computer Science, Data Science, Machine Learning, or a related field (or equivalent practical experience).",

    "description": "Location\n\nToronto\n\nEmployment Type\n\nFull time\n\nLocation Type\n\nOn-site\n\nDepartment\n\nDesign\n\nWho are we?\n\nOur mission is to scale intelligence to serve humanity. We’re training and deploying frontier models for developers and enterprises who are building AI systems to power magical experiences like content generation, semantic search, RAG, and agents. We believe that our work is instrumental to the widespread adoption of AI.\n\nWe obsess over what we build. Each one of us is responsible for contributing to increasing the capabilities of our models and the value they drive for our customers. We like to work hard and move fast to do what’s best for our customers.\n\nCohere is a team of researchers, engineers, designers, and more, who are passionate about their craft. Each person is one of the best in the world at what they do. We believe that a diverse range of perspectives is a requirement for building great products.\n\nJoin us on our mission and shape the future!\n\nAbout the Native team\n\nOn this product team, you will be responsible for bringing North to iOS and Android, translating our web experience into native-first interfaces that feel at home on mobile platforms. You'll help define the vision for North Native, determining what to adapt, what to reimagine, and what new capabilities mobile unlocks. This role requires fluency in both web and native design patterns, understanding when to maintain consistency with our existing experience and when platform conventions should take precedence. You'll be shaping the early product experience and design patterns that will serve as the foundation of North Native.\n\nIn this role, you will:\n• Own the design process end-to-end for Native experiences. Collaborate with Product on the mobile product vision and translate complex web workflows into intuitive native experiences optimized for iOS and Android.\n• Balance consistency with our web platform against native platform conventions, making thoughtful decisions about when to align and when to diverge based on user context and platform strengths.\n• Design with platform-specific patterns and capabilities in mind—leveraging native gestures, notifications, widgets, and system integrations to create experiences that feel truly native.\n• Partner closely with product managers and engineers throughout the development lifecycle, collaborating on technical feasibility, implementation details, and platform-specific constraints.\n• Conduct user research to understand mobile-specific use cases, behaviours, and expectations, ensuring Native delivers unique value rather than simply replicating the web experience.\n• Establish design patterns and guidelines for Native that scale across both platforms while accommodating platform-specific needs and future mobile capabilities.\n\nYou're likely a good fit if you have:\n• Product Design Experience: 3+ years designing digital products with a strong portfolio that demonstrates your process, systems thinking, and measurable impact on user outcomes.\n• Cross-Functional Partnership: A collaborative approach to product development—working closely with Product Managers to identify opportunities, with Engineers to navigate technical constraints and review implementations, and with stakeholders across the organization to align on solutions.\n• User-Centered Approach: A deep commitment to understanding user needs through research and direct engagement. You drive research initiatives, translate findings into design decisions, and stay informed on industry trends and AI developments that shape the product landscape.\n• Craft Excellence: Meticulous attention to craft and detail. You're proficient in Figma, build scalable component systems, and consistently elevate the quality of everything you touch. Bonus points for strong visual design skills in typography, layout, color, and composition.\n• Communication Skills: Clear, proactive communication that keeps distributed teams aligned. You document decisions, articulate design rationale to diverse audiences, and create shared understanding across geographies and disciplines.\n\nIf some of the above doesn’t line up perfectly with your experience, we still encourage you to apply!\n\nWe value and celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive work environment for all. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and are committed to providing equal opportunities. Should you require any accommodations during the recruitment process, please submit an Accommodations Request Form, and we will work together to meet your needs.\n\nFull-Time Employees at Cohere enjoy these Perks:\n\n🤝 An open and inclusive culture and work environment\n\n🧑‍💻 Work closely with a team on the cutting edge of AI research\n\n🍽 Weekly lunch stipend, in-office lunches & snacks\n\n🦷 Full health and dental benefits, including a separate budget to take care of your mental health\n\n🐣 100% Parental Leave top-up for up to 6 months\n\n🎨 Personal enrichment benefits towards arts and culture, fitness and well-being, quality time, and workspace improvement\n\n🏙 Remote-flexible, offices in Toronto, New York, San Francisco, London and Paris, as well as a co-working stipend\n\n✈️ 6 weeks of vacation (30 working days!)",

    "description": "Who are we?\n\nJoin us at the forefront of innovation in the AI sector. Our mission is to accelerate the future of work. We're not merely envisioning the future; we're actively constructing it.\n\nWe are a well-funded Silicon Valley based Series A startup backed by top-tier VCs, pioneering a new model of acquisition-led growth. Instead of building software companies the traditional way—chasing customers with sales and marketing—we acquire entire businesses and reinvent them from the inside out.\n\nOur founding team boasts a remarkable track record in AI and the startup ecosystem, with each member having previously steered AI startups to unicorn status (Cresta.ai).\n\nOur approach is not SaaS: We drive growth through acquisition and technology is our transformation engine. Each company we bring on board comes with complex workflows, legacy systems, and antiquated data structures. We turn that complexity into opportunity, designing platforms that unlock efficiency, scale, and profitability.\n\nWhat's in it for you?\n• Working with cutting-edge AI technologies on real-world transformation problems\n• Collaborate with world-class talent across engineering, product, and operations\n• Making an impact from day one - your work directly shapes how we transform entire industries\n• Challenging environment with a plethora of growth opportunities\n• Competitive compensation and benefits\n• High ownership and visibility in a small, high-trust team\n\nAbout the Role\n\nForward Deployed Data Scientists are our intelligence layer. You take messy, high-dimensional operational data from portfolio companies and turn it into models that uncover causality, optimize decisions, and forecast outcomes. Where others see noise, you find signal. Your work directly drives the business metrics that matter—cost reduction, revenue lift, operational efficiency.\n\nEach acquisition brings new data challenges. You'll inherit fragmented datasets, undocumented schemas, and business processes that have never been measured rigorously. Your job is to build the statistical and ML foundations that make transformation possible—then codify what worked into reusable frameworks across the portfolio.\n\nThis role requires travel. You'll embed with portfolio companies during critical phases—sitting with operations teams, understanding data at the source, and building trust with stakeholders who need to act on your models. Expect 20-40% travel depending on acquisition pace and project needs.\n\nWhat you will do\n\nModel Development & Causal Inference\n• Design, implement, test, and operationalize machine learning systems that uncover causality, optimize decisions, and forecast outcomes\n• Build statistical frameworks and quasi-experimental designs to quantify causal impact of interventions\n• Extend classical econometric approaches with modern ML—integrating gradient boosting, deep temporal models, or probabilistic programming where they add value\n\nData Mastery & Feature Engineering\n• Work with large-scale behavioral and operational datasets to extract signal from noise\n• Engineer robust features that capture business reality, not just statistical convenience\n• Generate actionable insights that translate directly to operational decisions\n\nProduction Deployment\n• Partner with engineering to deploy ML pipelines that are scalable, maintainable, and observable in production\n• Build monitoring and evaluation infrastructure that catches model drift before it impacts business outcomes\n• Own the full lifecycle: from exploratory analysis to production system to ongoing improvement\n\nBusiness Translation & Impact\n• Work with product and business stakeholders to translate ambiguous questions into measurable hypotheses\n• Deploy models that directly influence business outcomes—not just interesting research\n• Communicate technical insights in terms executives can act on\n\nPlatform & Playbook Development\n• Enhance reproducibility, code efficiency, and team velocity through automation and rigorous software engineering practices\n• Identify patterns across portfolio companies that can become reusable modeling frameworks\n• Contribute to data science playbooks that reduce time-to-insight for each subsequent acquisition\n\nWhat we look for\n• Advanced degree (Master's or PhD) in Data Science, Computer Science, Statistics, Econometrics, or a related technical field\n• Minimum 3 years of professional experience in data science, with a strong emphasis on applied machine learning, econometrics, or statistical modeling\n• Exceptional problem-solving abilities, effective communication, and teamwork skills\n• Comfort with ambiguity—you can walk into a newly acquired company with messy data and make order from chaos\n• Willingness to travel to portfolio company sites (20-40%) to embed with teams and understand data in context\n\nCore Statistical & ML Craft\n• Expertise in causal inference, experimental design, h probabilistic graphical models, and time series analysis\n• Proficiency in Python and ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, statsmodels, PyMC, or equivalent)\n• A first-principles, data-driven mindset; hands-on and comfortable working with complex, high-dimensional data\n• Strong debugging instincts—you can diagnose problems in models and pipelines you didn't build\n\nProduction Mindset\n• Ship production systems, not just notebooks—you've taken models from exploration to deployed\n• Experience with or willingness to learn MLOps and data pipeline orchestration in cloud environments (AWS, GCP, or Azure)\n• Understanding of when to use simple models vs. complex ones—interpretability for decisions that need explanation, sophistication where it drives measurable lift\n\nDomain Learning & Systems Thinking\n• Ability to rapidly learn new industries—you've gone deep on domains outside your background\n• Pattern recognition: you spot what's generalizable vs. one-off across different business contexts\n• Experience mapping complex business processes and identifying high-leverage measurement opportunities\n\nCommunication & Trust-Building\n• Excellent communication skills and the ability to translate technical insights into strategic impact\n• Experience working directly with business stakeholders—not just shipping models, but getting people to trust and act on what you build\n• Comfort presenting to executives and explaining trade-offs in non-technical terms\n\nBonus Points\n• Experience with or interest in integrating LLMs into ML, probabilistic modeling, or data science workflows\n• Background in specific verticals: financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, debt collection\n• Experience in early-stage startups, technical consulting roles (MBB), or similar high-ambiguity environments\n• Contributions to open-source ML tooling or frameworks\n\nWhy This Role Is Exciting\n• Repeatable impact: Every acquisition is a new deployment of the frameworks you've built—your work compounds. You will drive millions of EBITDA.\n• Platform influence: Your implementations directly shape what becomes the data science stack across the portfolio\n• Frontier technology: You're deploying advanced ML capabilities to transform legacy industries that haven't seen rigorous measurement in decades\n• Learning velocity: Every portfolio company is a masterclass in a new domain\n\nWe encourage you to apply, even if you don't meet all the criteria.",
