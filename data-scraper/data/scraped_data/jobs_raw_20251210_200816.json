    "description": "👋 Hi! We’re Jerry.ai. We’re building the first AI-powered AllCar™ super app to make car ownership affordable, seamless, and even magical. From insurance to repairs to road safety, we’re connecting the entire car ownership experience into one mobile-first platform. Our revenue has grown 60x in the last 5 years, we’re profitable, and our goal is to scale from 5M → 50M users next.\n\nWe’re looking for a Software Engineer II to join our Core Marketplace Automation Team, building automation systems that let our users self-serve, stay insured, and get the smoothest experience possible. This is a rare opportunity to work on software that directly impacts millions of users, automate complex business processes, and shape the future of insurance tech.\n\nWhy you’ll love working here\n• Real world impact: Your code touches millions of end users every day. Our automation systems already handle complex tasks like document uploads/verification, policy changes, payment, cancellations, and renewals — now we need to make them faster, smarter, and more seamless.\n• Meaningful work: Build tools that automate hundreds of human agent hours and scale our business efficiently. You’ll tackle different types of challenges every day, learning both the technical and business sides of our core products.\n• Zero bureaucracy: Have an idea? Pitch it, implement it, and see it live in days. No red tape, no slow-moving processes.\n• Brilliant + supportive teammates: Work with talented and kind engineers, product managers, and data scientists. Be in an environment that encourages challenging the status quo, innovation, collaboration, and helping each other succeed.\n• Flexibility: Work on projects that excite you. Explore new technologies, like AI/LLM tools, early — without bureaucracy slowing you down. Remote-friendly and flexible work arrangements allowing you to balance life and work, even internationally.\n• Growth + learning: Engineers at Jerry get to take a ton of ownership, swim outside their lanes, level up quickly, and mentor others. Everyone is passionate, involved, and cares intensely about their work and their teammates.\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n• Build automation systems that handle complex insurance servicing tasks end-to-end (policy endorsements, cancellations, document uploads, reinstatements) or reduce policy cancellations, improve renewals, and ensure users always have the best coverage.\n• Fast sprint cycles: ship new automations in 1–2 weeks on average.\n• Compose backend business logic that drives automation while respecting complex insurance carrier rules.\n• Design backend pipelines that sync customer policy data, deliver timely alerts, and power seamless re-shopping experiences.\n• Optimize and scale our internal tools (think: in-house DocuSign for servicing) to reduce agent intervention to nearly zero.\n• Collaborate closely with product, data, and engineering ops to anticipate churn and improve customer retention.\n• Work asynchronously across time zones, with minimal meetings but strong collaboration through Asana and Slack.\n• Continuously improve our backend systems, APIs, and microservice architecture.\n\nWhat We’re Looking For\n• Experience: At least 2 years full stack engineering experience building production-grade software, ideally prior experience building large scale distributed systems for a fast-growing consumer-facing software.\n• Tech stack: Strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and systems design matter more than having previous experience with specific languages or frameworks.\n• Problem solver: You enjoy tackling ambiguous problems, breaking them down into actionable code, and iterating quickly.\n• Ownership: You take responsibility for end-to-end outcomes and continuously improve the systems you build.\n• Collaboration: Comfortable working asynchronously across teams and time zones, with excellent communication skills.\n• Curiosity + adaptability: You love learning, exploring new tools, and stepping outside your comfort zone to understand the bigger picture.\n\nOur stack\n• Frontend & backend: TypeScript, Nest.js, Next.js, React, React Native, Expo\n• API: GraphQL\n• Data: Postgres, DynamoDB, Clickhouse, Redis\n• Infrastructure: AWS, microservices, containerized services on ECS/EKS, asynchronous processing on Lambda\n\nWhy Jerry?\n\nThis isn’t just another coding job — you’ll be solving real-world problems at scale, helping millions of people manage their most expensive (or at least second most expensive) asset more effortlessly. You’ll work in a flexible, fast-moving, and highly collaborative culture, where innovation is encouraged, your voice is heard, and the impact of your work is immediate. You’ll tackle meaningful challenges, learn constantly, and grow alongside extremely talented engineers.\n\n🚀 If this sounds like your kind of place, we want to meet you!\n\nWhile we appreciate your interest and application, only applicants under consideration will be contacted.\n\nJerry.ai is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer. We prohibit discrimination based on race, religion, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, reproductive health decisions or related medical conditions, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other characteristics protected by applicable local, state or federal laws.\n\nJerry.ai is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities in our job application process. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please contact us at recruiting@jerry.ai\n\nThe successful candidate’s starting pay will fall within the pay range listed on this job posting, determined based on job-related factors including, but not limited to, skills, experience, qualifications, work location, and market conditions. Ranges are market-dependent and may be modified in the future. In addition to base salary, the compensation may include opportunities for equity grants.\n\nWe offer a comprehensive benefits package to regular employees, including health, dental, and vision coverage, paid time off, paid parental leave, 401(K) plan with employer matching, and wellness benefits, among others. Equity opportunities may also be part of your total rewards package. Part-time, contract, or freelance roles may not be eligible for certain benefits.\n\nAbout Jerry.ai\n\nJerry.ai is America’s first and only super app to radically simplify car ownership.

    "description": "At Loblaw Digital, we know that our customers expect the best from us. Whether that means building the best, most innovative online shopping experience, or designing an app that will impact the lives of people across the country, we’re up for the challenge. From our office in Downtown Toronto, we’ve created leading eCommerce experiences in the online grocery shopping, beauty, pharmacy, and apparel spaces, and we’re only just getting started.\n\nWhy is this role important?\n\nAs a Staff Developer, you will be working closely with the Software Development Managers to help oversee the technology vision, software quality and operational excellence. Partnering with the Engineering leads, you will define the technical metrics and outcomes for the teams to strive towards. Using your extensive knowledge and experience with technology, you will work with the other developers on those applications to further their growth and abilities.\n\nWhat You'll Do\n• Take ownership of the technological vision, software quality, and operational excellence for the eCommerce platform teams, including architecture, metrics and practices.\n• Lead by example in building great software. Get hands-on with the code, such as building a proof of concept, tackling a gnarly bug or feature. Participate in the design and delivery of new features in a collaborative agile/scrum environment.\n• Responsible for designing and implementing scalable and resilient systems that meet the needs of our rapidly growing business.\n• Find ways to coach and level-up the technical skills of multiple pods of developers using your knowledge and expertise. Provide mentoring, especially to Senior Developers. Drive reviews of technical artifacts.\n• Look out and advocate for opportunities to improve our technical processes to enable the best performance out of our teams as possible.\n• Build strong relationships with developers and peer technologists across the organization. Work collaboratively across practices, levels, and organizational structure to find the right solution. The solution of choice may be to reuse an existing enterprise standard, but it could also be to innovate our processes and technology.\n• Foster a culture of continuous inclusivity and improvement.\n\nDoes this sound like you?\n• Extensive experience (8+ years) with Java and a variety of technologies including distributed systems, microservices architecture.\n• Proven track record of working on large and complex software systems that span across teams.\n• Hands-on experience working with event-driven architecture and implementing solutions using this paradigm.\n• Experience working with Relational and NoSQL database at scale.\n• Professional experience with GCP or equivalent cloud technology.\n• You are a self-starter with a passion for building high-quality software, and thrive in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.\n• You are skilled at asking the right questions to understand new technology, and proficient at communicating the implications of high-level constraints and stakeholder decisions both verbally and in writing.\n• You are comfortable making decisions in the face of ambiguity. Your technology choices, designs, and architectures use as much data as is practical from a variety of sources.\n• You communicate clearly and effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences alike. You can present complicated solutions in a simple and logical way. Your diagrams are crisp and clean. Your documents are organized, clear, and concise.\n• You are a thought leader for innovation and will champion the optimization and maturing of technology practices in collaboration with key stakeholders.\n\nHow You’ll Succeed:\n\nAt Loblaw Digital, we seek great people to continually strengthen our culture. We believe great people model our values, are authentic, build trust and make connections.\n\nWe’re able to keep innovating because our colleagues are passionate about their work and excited about the future of eCommerce.\n\nIf you have big ideas, undeniable enthusiasm, and thrive in a collaborative, creative, and diverse group, we’ll get along just fine.\n\nLooking for a challenge? Good. Love an innovative work environment? Even better.\n\nApply today.\n\nEmployment Type:\nFull time\n\nType of Role:\nRegular\n\nLoblaw Digital recognizes Canada's diversity as a source of national pride and strength. We have made it a priority to reflect our nation’s evolving diversity in the products we sell, the people we hire, and the culture we create in our organization. Accommodation is available upon request for applicants with disabilities in the recruitment and assessment process and when hired.\n\nIn addition, we believe that compliance with laws is about doing the right thing.

You proactively seek out bugs and fix them. Occasionally, when bugs find you, you don't sweep them under the rug.\n• You are experienced with software estimation, often confronted with complexity and uncertainty.\n• You make decisions based on data. You are versed with tools to measure every aspect of the application.\n• You have developed large applications in a team environment.\n• You are not afraid of changes. Armed with excellent refactoring techniques, you work effectively with legacy code.\n• You are a good communicator. You can present complicated solutions to non-technical audience in a simple and logical way.\n\nHow You’ll Succeed:\n\nAt Loblaw Digital, we seek great people to continually strengthen our culture. We believe great people model our values, are authentic, build trust and make connections.\n\nWe’re able to keep innovating because our colleagues are passionate about their work and excited about the future of eCommerce.\n\nIf you have big ideas, undeniable enthusiasm, and thrive in a collaborative, creative, and diverse group, we’ll get along just fine.\n\nLooking for a challenge?
