Make it easier for practitioners to access the products they trust so they can deliver better care. That simple idea grew into a platform that powers every part of care. Today, more than 125,000 practitioners use Fullscript for clinical insights, lab interpretations, patient analytics, education, and access to high-quality supplements.

We’re the group that keeps the platform upright: reliable, efficient, and able to scale as the business grows. We’re hiring a Senior Fullstack Developer to join this team. You’ll work in our profile and audience lane, where customer, product, and marketing data come together to power personalization and insight across the platform. This role is a fit for someone who loves creating well-designed systems, building reusable tooling, and partnering closely with technical and non-technical teams to ship solutions that last. You’ll write production-grade backend and fullstack code, shape foundational architecture, and build the packages and SDKs other engineers rely on. You’ll operate with autonomy, collaborate across domains, and bring clarity, curiosity, and good judgment to a space that grows more important every quarter. This is a hands-on engineering role, not a pure data role. You’ll work deeply across backend services, developer tooling, event-driven systems, and the infrastructure that moves and shapes data at scale. What you’ll do • Design and build backend services that support event ingestion, identity stitching, profile creation, and downstream activation. • Develop SDKs, packages, and reusable components. As well as publish them internally or externally to support instrumentation, governance, and developer experience. • Build internal tools and fullstack workflow surfaces that help teams understand, use, and trust the data flowing through their systems. • Improve data flows end-to-end for correctness, performance, and scalability. • Collaborate with PMs, analysts, marketers, and engineers across multiple teams to define requirements and shape solutions. • Validate pipelines and event streams, identify issues, and drive resolution. • Work with senior engineers on architectural initiatives around storage, lineage, schema design, and event modeling. • Write clear, maintainable, well-tested code (and contribute to the patterns and standards that keep our systems healthy). What you bring • 5+ years of software development experience with a strong focus on backend and fullstack systems. • Proficiency in Ruby or another modern backend language (Go, Python, TypeScript, etc.). • Experience building APIs, services, or ingestion systems that handle data at scale. • Strong SQL skills and comfort with data modeling, query optimization, and schema design. • Familiarity with event-driven architectures and tools such as Snowflake, Kafka, Rudderstack, Segment, or similar technologies. • Experience building reusable libraries, packages, or SDKs intended for other developers. • Comfort collaborating across disciplines (engineering, analytics, product, marketing, etc) and bringing clarity to complex problems. • Ability to work independently in an async-friendly environment with clear direction but minimal supervision. • A low-ego, team-first mindset. You communicate well, listen well, and don’t create friction. Bonus if you have • Experience contributing to open-source projects or publishing packages to public registries (npm, RubyGems, PyPI, etc.). • Experience with Snowflake or other large-scale cloud data warehouses. • Familiarity with GraphQL APIs or schema design. • Background in instrumentation, observability, or developer experience tooling. • Experience in SaaS, eCommerce, or health tech environments. What we can offer you • Ability to work Wherever You Work Well* • Flexible Paid Time Off program • Fullscript’s RRSP match program • Stock Options • Custom benefits package (medical, dental, vision) with HSA • Discount on Fullscript catalog of products for family & friends • Training budget and company-wide learning initiatives • Employee Wellness Programs Why Fullscript Great work happens when people feel supported, trusted, and inspired. At Fullscript, we stay curious and keep finding smarter ways to make care better. We grow together, take on new challenges, and focus on impact.

You proactively seek out bugs and fix them. Occasionally, when bugs find you, you don't sweep them under the rug. • You are experienced with software estimation, often confronted with complexity and uncertainty. • You make decisions based on data. You are versed with tools to measure every aspect of the application. • You have developed large applications in a team environment. • You are not afraid of changes. Armed with excellent refactoring techniques, you work effectively with legacy code. • You are a good communicator. You can present complicated solutions to non-technical audience in a simple and logical way. How You’ll Succeed: At Loblaw Digital, we seek great people to continually strengthen our culture.

    "description": "It's no secret that traditional site reliability teams struggle to keep pace with manual monitoring, reactive troubleshooting, and labor-intensive deployments. The rise of AI presents a solution, but many companies fail to fully leverage its potential, resulting in systems that underperform and bottlenecks that stifle innovation. Data shows that 73% of companies struggle with deployment delays and operational downtime, primarily due to outdated processes and lack of AI-driven automation. At IgniteTech, we are tackling these issues head-on by building AI-first cloud solutions that are designed to anticipate and prevent problems before they arise. We focus on integrating AI and machine learning into every facet of cloud infrastructure management, from automated monitoring systems to intelligent CI/CD pipelines. This approach creates environments that not only self-heal but also continuously evolve, reducing downtime, improving performance, and pushing the boundaries of what cloud services can do. This isn’t your typical site reliability role, where you'd be reacting to problems and manually intervening when things go wrong. Here, you’ll lead the charge in building AI-enhanced monitoring systems that detect and resolve 95% of issues before they ever reach end users. You’ll also architect and manage AI-automated CI/CD pipelines that reduce deployment times by 30% while slashing manual interventions.

    "description": "Imagine if you could write Python code that doesn’t just move data—but moves the needle on how the modern insurance industry functions. You’re not building another feature flag for a SaaS dashboard. You’re writing backend systems that support machine learning models tasked with identifying truth (or at least a statistically reliable approximation of it) in an industry built on uncertainty: insurance. This is not a vibe-based startup. It's a well-capitalized AI company where engineering decisions are consequential and the work is rooted in measurable outcomes. The product helps insurers detect fraudulent claims using a data-driven platform that aims to remove bias—because the stakes aren’t likes or clicks; they’re dollars and liability. You’ll be the kind of engineer who prefers to spend time writing backend Python that automates infrastructure logic, builds internal tools, or glues together machine learning pipelines in AWS. Terraform is here, obviously. So are EC2, RDS, Lambda, and other expected acronyms. But what sets this apart is the opportunity to shape how it all functions—functionally. And yes, this role is onsite, in Toronto or Vancouver. You’ll be around other engineers who care about systems, not just shipping tickets. Required Skills & Experience • 3–6 years of experience in software engineering, with real backend Python contributions—ideally building infrastructure tools, internal APIs, or deployment logic • Solid experience with AWS tooling and a habit of understanding the why, not just the how • Proven experience with infrastructure-as-code tooling like Terraform or AWS CDK Desired Skills & Experience • Comfort overseeing Monitoring and reliability Familiarity with CI/CD tooling and systems that don’t fall apart under pressure Daily Responsibilities • Hands-On Engineering: 70% • Team Collaboration & Cross-Functional Work: 30% Applicants must be currently authorized to work in Canada on a full-time basis now and in the future.

    "description": "It's no secret that traditional site reliability teams struggle to keep pace with manual monitoring, reactive troubleshooting, and labor-intensive deployments. The rise of AI presents a solution, but many companies fail to fully leverage its potential, resulting in systems that underperform and bottlenecks that stifle innovation. Data shows that 73% of companies struggle with deployment delays and operational downtime, primarily due to outdated processes and lack of AI-driven automation. At IgniteTech, we are tackling these issues head-on by building AI-first cloud solutions that are designed to anticipate and prevent problems before they arise. We focus on integrating AI and machine learning into every facet of cloud infrastructure management, from automated monitoring systems to intelligent CI/CD pipelines. This approach creates environments that not only self-heal but also continuously evolve, reducing downtime, improving performance, and pushing the boundaries of what cloud services can do. This isn’t your typical site reliability role, where you'd be reacting to problems and manually intervening when things go wrong. Here, you’ll lead the charge in building AI-enhanced monitoring systems that detect and resolve 95% of issues before they ever reach end users. You’ll also architect and manage AI-automated CI/CD pipelines that reduce deployment times by 30% while slashing manual interventions.
