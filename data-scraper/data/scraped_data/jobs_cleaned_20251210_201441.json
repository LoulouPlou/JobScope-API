    "description": "About Thri5 Thri5 is the AI-powered System of Actions for the modern retailer. Despite massive investments in planning, forecasting, and analytics, retailers still face the same operational issuesout-of-stocks, bad master data, margin leakage, and inconsistent execution across stores and channels. The gap isn't in intelligence; it's in execution. Thri5 continually scans data across the business, detects and prioritizes opportunities, evaluates impact, and orchestrates execution through both humans and AI agents. From store managers and DC leaders to category and supply chain teams, Thri5 routes the right actions to the right ownerswith clear context, recommendations, and workflowsclosing the gap between plan and real-world performance. Our vision is to become the trusted AI operating layer for retail execution, making every operator 10x more effective and freeing them to focus on what matters most: serving customers and growing the business. Founded by a team with deep retail and retail-technology experience, Thri5 is venture-backed by some of Canada's most prominent VC and angel investors. Your Role As an AI / Machine Learning Engineer at Thri5, you'll help build the agent layer that powers our System of Actions. You'll design and implement multi-agent Co-pilot systems that orchestrate complex workflows, call tools and APIs, and automate operational tasks at scale. You'll also develop deterministic, data-driven detection models to reliably identify operational issues and opportunitiesand then layer LLM-based capabilities on top to generate high-quality alerts, recommended actions, and explanations grounded in real retail data. You'll work closely with the founding team to turn messy, real-world retail problems into robust, production agent workflows that operators actually trust and use every day. Key Responsibilities Agent Framework & Orchestration • Design and build the core frameworks that power Thri5's AI agents: task decomposition, routing, tool calling, multi-step workflows, and human-in-the-loop escalation. • Implement agents that coordinate across operators (store, DC, category, supply chain) and systems to drive real actions, not just insights. LLM-Driven Intelligence • Develop and fine-tune LLM-based components to detect anomalies and opportunities that impact commercial and operational performance. • Build prompt, retrieval, and grounding patterns that produce reliable behaviour in noisy, real-world data. • Combine deterministic signals with LLMs to produce contextual narratives, explanations, and recommended actions. Deterministic Detection & Scoring • Design and implement deterministic and semi-deterministic detection models (e.g., statistical anomaly detection, rules + ML hybrids, scoring systems) to identify out-of-stocks, bad master data, and execution gaps. • Build evaluation frameworks (precision/recall, false positive control, business impact, backtests) to ensure detections are trustworthy and stable in production. • Collaborate with product and domain experts to translate heuristics and business rules into robust, maintainable detection logic. Data & Recommendation Pipelines • Build and optimize pipelines that leverage real-time and batch customer data (transactions, inventory, operations) to power agent decisions and recommendations. • Own end-to-end ML workflowsdata preprocessing, feature engineering, training, evaluation, and production inference. MLOps / LLMOps & Reliability • Implement robust MLOps practices for CI/CD, experimentation, and monitoring of models and agents. • Instrument and monitor agent behaviour (latency, cost, quality, safety) and continuously iterate to improve performance, accuracy, and scalability. Collaboration & Product • Partner with product and engineering to translate customer problems into concrete agent capabilities and use cases. • Contribute to technical decision-making and architecture as we scale the Thri5 platform. Requirements • AI Fluency: 5+ years of software development experience with deep exposure to modern AI/ML, including both classical ML / data science and LLMs, GPT-style models, and agent/tool-calling ecosystems. • ML / Data Science Proficiency: Strong background in supervised/unsupervised learning and anomaly detection, with hands-on experience designing deterministic or semi-deterministic detection systems (statistical models, rules + ML, scoring). Comfortable with model evaluation, experimentation, and translating business heuristics into data-driven logic. • Programming & Frameworks: Proficient in Python and familiar with ML frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. Experience with GenAI tooling (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, custom agent frameworks) and vector databases is an asset. • Data Handling: Comfortable working with large-scale datasets, complex schemas, and event-driven data. Strong SQL skills and experience building data pipelines into production systems. • Startup Mindset: Thrive in a fast-paced, ambiguous environment; able to bring structure to open-ended problems. Enjoy high accountability and end-to-end ownership from idea to production impact. • Teamwork: Collaborative, low-ego, and comfortable working across a small, high-performing team (founders, engineers, product, and customers). • Domain Experience (Nice to Have): Experience in retail, supply chain, predictive analytics, time-series modeling, or operational optimization. • Education: Bachelor's, Master's or Ph.D. in Computer Science, Data Science, Machine Learning, or a related field (or equivalent practical experience).",

    "description": "Location Toronto Employment Type Full time Location Type On-site Department Design Who are we? Our mission is to scale intelligence to serve humanity. We’re training and deploying frontier models for developers and enterprises who are building AI systems to power magical experiences like content generation, semantic search, RAG, and agents. We believe that our work is instrumental to the widespread adoption of AI. We obsess over what we build. Each one of us is responsible for contributing to increasing the capabilities of our models and the value they drive for our customers. We like to work hard and move fast to do what’s best for our customers. Cohere is a team of researchers, engineers, designers, and more, who are passionate about their craft. Each person is one of the best in the world at what they do. We believe that a diverse range of perspectives is a requirement for building great products. Join us on our mission and shape the future! About the Native team On this product team, you will be responsible for bringing North to iOS and Android, translating our web experience into native-first interfaces that feel at home on mobile platforms. You'll help define the vision for North Native, determining what to adapt, what to reimagine, and what new capabilities mobile unlocks. This role requires fluency in both web and native design patterns, understanding when to maintain consistency with our existing experience and when platform conventions should take precedence. You'll be shaping the early product experience and design patterns that will serve as the foundation of North Native. In this role, you will: • Own the design process end-to-end for Native experiences. Collaborate with Product on the mobile product vision and translate complex web workflows into intuitive native experiences optimized for iOS and Android. • Balance consistency with our web platform against native platform conventions, making thoughtful decisions about when to align and when to diverge based on user context and platform strengths. • Design with platform-specific patterns and capabilities in mind—leveraging native gestures, notifications, widgets, and system integrations to create experiences that feel truly native. • Partner closely with product managers and engineers throughout the development lifecycle, collaborating on technical feasibility, implementation details, and platform-specific constraints. • Conduct user research to understand mobile-specific use cases, behaviours, and expectations, ensuring Native delivers unique value rather than simply replicating the web experience. • Establish design patterns and guidelines for Native that scale across both platforms while accommodating platform-specific needs and future mobile capabilities. You're likely a good fit if you have: • Product Design Experience: 3+ years designing digital products with a strong portfolio that demonstrates your process, systems thinking, and measurable impact on user outcomes. • Cross-Functional Partnership: A collaborative approach to product development—working closely with Product Managers to identify opportunities, with Engineers to navigate technical constraints and review implementations, and with stakeholders across the organization to align on solutions. • User-Centered Approach: A deep commitment to understanding user needs through research and direct engagement. You drive research initiatives, translate findings into design decisions, and stay informed on industry trends and AI developments that shape the product landscape. • Craft Excellence: Meticulous attention to craft and detail. You're proficient in Figma, build scalable component systems, and consistently elevate the quality of everything you touch. Bonus points for strong visual design skills in typography, layout, color, and composition. • Communication Skills: Clear, proactive communication that keeps distributed teams aligned. You document decisions, articulate design rationale to diverse audiences, and create shared understanding across geographies and disciplines. If some of the above doesn’t line up perfectly with your experience, we still encourage you to apply! We value and celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive work environment for all. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and are committed to providing equal opportunities. Should you require any accommodations during the recruitment process, please submit an Accommodations Request Form, and we will work together to meet your needs.

    "description": "Who are we? Join us at the forefront of innovation in the AI sector. Our mission is to accelerate the future of work. We're not merely envisioning the future; we're actively constructing it. We are a well-funded Silicon Valley based Series A startup backed by top-tier VCs, pioneering a new model of acquisition-led growth. Instead of building software companies the traditional way—chasing customers with sales and marketing—we acquire entire businesses and reinvent them from the inside out. Our founding team boasts a remarkable track record in AI and the startup ecosystem, with each member having previously steered AI startups to unicorn status (Cresta.ai). Our approach is not SaaS: We drive growth through acquisition and technology is our transformation engine. Each company we bring on board comes with complex workflows, legacy systems, and antiquated data structures. We turn that complexity into opportunity, designing platforms that unlock efficiency, scale, and profitability. What's in it for you? • Working with cutting-edge AI technologies on real-world transformation problems • Collaborate with world-class talent across engineering, product, and operations • Making an impact from day one - your work directly shapes how we transform entire industries • Challenging environment with a plethora of growth opportunities • Competitive compensation and benefits • High ownership and visibility in a small, high-trust team About the Role Forward Deployed Data Scientists are our intelligence layer. You take messy, high-dimensional operational data from portfolio companies and turn it into models that uncover causality, optimize decisions, and forecast outcomes. Where others see noise, you find signal. Your work directly drives the business metrics that matter—cost reduction, revenue lift, operational efficiency. Each acquisition brings new data challenges. You'll inherit fragmented datasets, undocumented schemas, and business processes that have never been measured rigorously. Your job is to build the statistical and ML foundations that make transformation possible—then codify what worked into reusable frameworks across the portfolio. This role requires travel. You'll embed with portfolio companies during critical phases—sitting with operations teams, understanding data at the source, and building trust with stakeholders who need to act on your models. Expect 20-40% travel depending on acquisition pace and project needs. What you will do Model Development & Causal Inference • Design, implement, test, and operationalize machine learning systems that uncover causality, optimize decisions, and forecast outcomes • Build statistical frameworks and quasi-experimental designs to quantify causal impact of interventions • Extend classical econometric approaches with modern ML—integrating gradient boosting, deep temporal models, or probabilistic programming where they add value Data Mastery & Feature Engineering • Work with large-scale behavioral and operational datasets to extract signal from noise • Engineer robust features that capture business reality, not just statistical convenience • Generate actionable insights that translate directly to operational decisions Production Deployment • Partner with engineering to deploy ML pipelines that are scalable, maintainable, and observable in production • Build monitoring and evaluation infrastructure that catches model drift before it impacts business outcomes • Own the full lifecycle: from exploratory analysis to production system to ongoing improvement Business Translation & Impact • Work with product and business stakeholders to translate ambiguous questions into measurable hypotheses • Deploy models that directly influence business outcomes—not just interesting research • Communicate technical insights in terms executives can act on Platform & Playbook Development • Enhance reproducibility, code efficiency, and team velocity through automation and rigorous software engineering practices • Identify patterns across portfolio companies that can become reusable modeling frameworks • Contribute to data science playbooks that reduce time-to-insight for each subsequent acquisition What we look for • Advanced degree (Master's or PhD) in Data Science, Computer Science, Statistics, Econometrics, or a related technical field • Minimum 3 years of professional experience in data science, with a strong emphasis on applied machine learning, econometrics, or statistical modeling • Exceptional problem-solving abilities, effective communication, and teamwork skills • Comfort with ambiguity—you can walk into a newly acquired company with messy data and make order from chaos • Willingness to travel to portfolio company sites (20-40%) to embed with teams and understand data in context Core Statistical & ML Craft • Expertise in causal inference, experimental design, h probabilistic graphical models, and time series analysis • Proficiency in Python and ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, statsmodels, PyMC, or equivalent) • A first-principles, data-driven mindset; hands-on and comfortable working with complex, high-dimensional data • Strong debugging instincts—you can diagnose problems in models and pipelines you didn't build Production Mindset • Ship production systems, not just notebooks—you've taken models from exploration to deployed • Experience with or willingness to learn MLOps and data pipeline orchestration in cloud environments (AWS, GCP, or Azure) • Understanding of when to use simple models vs. complex ones—interpretability for decisions that need explanation, sophistication where it drives measurable lift Domain Learning & Systems Thinking • Ability to rapidly learn new industries—you've gone deep on domains outside your background • Pattern recognition: you spot what's generalizable vs. one-off across different business contexts • Experience mapping complex business processes and identifying high-leverage measurement opportunities Communication & Trust-Building • Excellent communication skills and the ability to translate technical insights into strategic impact • Experience working directly with business stakeholders—not just shipping models, but getting people to trust and act on what you build • Comfort presenting to executives and explaining trade-offs in non-technical terms Bonus Points • Experience with or interest in integrating LLMs into ML, probabilistic modeling, or data science workflows • Background in specific verticals: financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, debt collection • Experience in early-stage startups, technical consulting roles (MBB), or similar high-ambiguity environments • Contributions to open-source ML tooling or frameworks Why This Role Is Exciting • Repeatable impact: Every acquisition is a new deployment of the frameworks you've built—your work compounds. You will drive millions of EBITDA. • Platform influence: Your implementations directly shape what becomes the data science stack across the portfolio • Frontier technology: You're deploying advanced ML capabilities to transform legacy industries that haven't seen rigorous measurement in decades • Learning velocity: Every portfolio company is a masterclass in a new domain We encourage you to apply, even if you don't meet all the criteria.",

Work with intelligent people in an exciting environment where every month is different. Positions Available: • Full time UI/UX Designer • Other Positions : We are also hiring for other positions (front-end developer, digital advertising specialist, media and marketing communications, marketing project manager, business analyst, account manager, infrastructure analyst, software developer, and more). You may apply for multiple positions separately. If you know someone in any of these areas, please do them a quick and friendly favour by letting them know about this posting. Position Overview: • Full time and permanent • Fast moving in terms of variety of work and expectations. • Flexible hours (for example: choose to start your day between 6am and 10am, work late some days and shorter on others). • 65% internal projects (for multiple product lines), 35% client projects • Gain valuable career experience with campaigns from mature departments to early stage start-up departments , and from patented disruptive products to more routine competitive sectors. • Gain valuable career experience in a variety of platforms (for example: web, responsive web, native mobile phone, tablet, and maybe even kiosk). • Gain experience with both simple and highly complex projects . • Responsible for ensuring a world-class user experience in terms of clarity of meaning, discovery of features, and speed of use. • Part of a team of several UX designers. • Will get to know our brand over the long-term to produce deep insight \"wow\" results that continue our brand's fast growth. • Interviewing stakeholders to determine the purpose and goals of new software, or starting from business requirement documents. • Informal usability studies like watching in-person or video usage of software to discover areas needing improvement. • Formal usability studies (fairly rare). • Creating wireframes, interactive mockups , and innovative concept proposals. • Collaborating with the marketing team and front-end developers. • Engage in constructive debate to challenge designs; standing up for your choices, while being willing to use respectful criticism, with or without the sugar coating, to iterate into even better designs. • Does not require technical front-end development, although positions are possible for those that prefer doing both sides but still excel at UX Design. • Does not involve a focus on consistency or lengthy design standard documents: we want to push new boundries, not be repeatedly tied to previous design decisions. • This is not a role created due to UX hype and with no understanding of its function or value: this role will be an integral part of many projects. Requirements: • Highly intelligent • Superb spatial reasoning • Deep appreciation for how different platforms involve different usage patterns. • Gets deeply involved with challenges and will persevere at length to achieve victory. • Passionate about user experiences. • Takes pride in work. • No specific requirements for formal education or industry experience.
