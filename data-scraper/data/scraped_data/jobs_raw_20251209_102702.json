    "description": "About Fullscript\n\nWe’re an industry-leading health technology company on a mission to help people get better. We started in 2011 with one simple idea. Make it easier for practitioners to access the products they trust so they can deliver better care.\n\nThat simple idea grew into a platform that powers every part of care. Today, more than 125,000 practitioners use Fullscript for clinical insights, lab interpretations, patient analytics, education, and access to high-quality supplements. Over 10 million patients rely on Fullscript to stay connected to their care plans and follow through on treatment.\n\nWe build tools that make care smarter and more human. Tools that save time, simplify decisions, and help practitioners stay closely connected to the people they care for. When everything they need is in one place, they can focus on what matters most: helping people get better.\n\nThis is your invitation.\n\nBring your ideas, your grit, and your care for people.\nJoin us and shape the future of care.\n\nThe Hercules team builds the backbone of Fullscript’s data ecosystem; everything from the services, models, and tooling that make sure the right data reaches the right systems in the right shape. We’re the group that keeps the platform upright: reliable, efficient, and able to scale as the business grows.\n\nWe’re hiring a Senior Fullstack Developer to join this team. You’ll work in our profile and audience lane, where customer, product, and marketing data come together to power personalization and insight across the platform. This role is a fit for someone who loves creating well-designed systems, building reusable tooling, and partnering closely with technical and non-technical teams to ship solutions that last.\n\nYou’ll write production-grade backend and fullstack code, shape foundational architecture, and build the packages and SDKs other engineers rely on. You’ll operate with autonomy, collaborate across domains, and bring clarity, curiosity, and good judgment to a space that grows more important every quarter.\n\nThis is a hands-on engineering role, not a pure data role. You’ll work deeply across backend services, developer tooling, event-driven systems, and the infrastructure that moves and shapes data at scale.\nWhat you’ll do\n• Design and build backend services that support event ingestion, identity stitching, profile creation, and downstream activation.\n• Develop SDKs, packages, and reusable components. As well as publish them internally or externally to support instrumentation, governance, and developer experience.\n• Build internal tools and fullstack workflow surfaces that help teams understand, use, and trust the data flowing through their systems.\n• Improve data flows end-to-end for correctness, performance, and scalability.\n• Collaborate with PMs, analysts, marketers, and engineers across multiple teams to define requirements and shape solutions.\n• Validate pipelines and event streams, identify issues, and drive resolution.\n• Work with senior engineers on architectural initiatives around storage, lineage, schema design, and event modeling.\n• Write clear, maintainable, well-tested code (and contribute to the patterns and standards that keep our systems healthy).\nWhat you bring\n• 5+ years of software development experience with a strong focus on backend and fullstack systems.\n• Proficiency in Ruby or another modern backend language (Go, Python, TypeScript, etc.).\n• Experience building APIs, services, or ingestion systems that handle data at scale.\n• Strong SQL skills and comfort with data modeling, query optimization, and schema design.\n• Familiarity with event-driven architectures and tools such as Snowflake, Kafka, Rudderstack, Segment, or similar technologies.\n• Experience building reusable libraries, packages, or SDKs intended for other developers.\n• Comfort collaborating across disciplines (engineering, analytics, product, marketing, etc) and bringing clarity to complex problems.\n• Ability to work independently in an async-friendly environment with clear direction but minimal supervision.\n• A low-ego, team-first mindset. You communicate well, listen well, and don’t create friction.\nBonus if you have\n• Experience contributing to open-source projects or publishing packages to public registries (npm, RubyGems, PyPI, etc.).\n• Experience with Snowflake or other large-scale cloud data warehouses.\n• Familiarity with GraphQL APIs or schema design.\n• Background in instrumentation, observability, or developer experience tooling.\n• Experience in SaaS, eCommerce, or health tech environments.\nWhat we can offer you\n• Ability to work Wherever You Work Well*\n• Flexible Paid Time Off program\n• Fullscript’s RRSP match program\n• Stock Options\n• Custom benefits package (medical, dental, vision) with HSA\n• Discount on Fullscript catalog of products for family & friends\n• Training budget and company-wide learning initiatives\n• Employee Wellness Programs\nWhy Fullscript\n\nGreat work happens when people feel supported, trusted, and inspired. At Fullscript, we stay curious and keep finding smarter ways to make care better. We grow together, take on new challenges, and focus on impact. We put people first, work as a team, and leave egos at the door.\n\nWhat to Know Before You Apply\n\nWe’re grateful for the interest in joining Fullscript. To make sure your application reaches our hiring team, please apply directly through our careers page. We’re not able to respond to individual messages about open roles on email or social channels.\n\nFullscript is an equal opportunity employer committed to creating an inclusive workplace. Accommodations are available upon request at accommodations@fullscript.com.\n\nAll offers are contingent on successful background checks conducted in compliance with federal, state, and provincial laws.\nWe use AI tools to support parts of the hiring process, including screening and reviewing responses. Final hiring decisions are always made by people and follow all applicable privacy and employment laws in Canada and the U.S.\n\nLearn More\n\nwww.fullscript.com\n@fullscriptHQ on instagram\nLet’s make healthcare whole",

    "description": "It's no secret that traditional site reliability teams struggle to keep pace with manual monitoring, reactive troubleshooting, and labor-intensive deployments. The rise of AI presents a solution, but many companies fail to fully leverage its potential, resulting in systems that underperform and bottlenecks that stifle innovation. Data shows that 73% of companies struggle with deployment delays and operational downtime, primarily due to outdated processes and lack of AI-driven automation.\n\nAt IgniteTech, we are tackling these issues head-on by building AI-first cloud solutions that are designed to anticipate and prevent problems before they arise. We focus on integrating AI and machine learning into every facet of cloud infrastructure management, from automated monitoring systems to intelligent CI/CD pipelines. This approach creates environments that not only self-heal but also continuously evolve, reducing downtime, improving performance, and pushing the boundaries of what cloud services can do.\n\nThis isn’t your typical site reliability role, where you'd be reacting to problems and manually intervening when things go wrong. Here, you’ll lead the charge in building AI-enhanced monitoring systems that detect and resolve 95% of issues before they ever reach end users. You’ll also architect and manage AI-automated CI/CD pipelines that reduce deployment times by 30% while slashing manual interventions. The ideal candidate thrives in an AI-driven environment, is excited by the prospect of automation-first solutions, and enjoys pushing the envelope of cloud infrastructure design.\n\nIn this role, you’ll join a global team of innovators who are redefining cloud infrastructure. Your work will play a key role in our mission to deliver next-gen, AI-driven operational excellence. We’re seeking someone who is passionate about AI and ready to make a lasting impact on the future of cloud services. If that’s you, we encourage you to apply and be part of something revolutionary.\n\nWhat you will be doing\n• Implementing AI-based monitoring services to automatically detect, predict, and resolve issues before they impact operations\n• Managing CI/CD pipelines with AI-driven automation to enhance deployment efficiency and reduce manual intervention\n\nWhat you won’t be doing\n• Focusing solely on manual monitoring, troubleshooting, and maintenance of systems; your goal will be to get AI to do these things for you\n\nAI-First Site Reliability Engineer key responsibilities\n• Achieve seamless scalability and optimize performance for AI-powered cloud services, ensuring 99.99% uptime while delivering AI-enhanced software upgrades and customizations that meet clients' evolving needs\n\nBasic Requirements\n• AI-First Mindset (if your instinct is to write code first and then use AI tools to verify or enhance your code, rather than the other way around, then please do not apply)\n• At least 3 years of DevOps experience, including automation of CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure management\n• At least 2 years of experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP)\n• Proficiency in AI and machine learning tools used for monitoring, automation, and predictive analytics (or strong willingness to learn and adapt to AI-driven technologies)\n• Strong programming and scripting skills, with experience in automating tasks and building AI-driven processes\n\nAbout IgniteTech\n\nWorld-class talent. 100% global remote.\n\nReady to be a part of the top talent that IgniteTech has curated from thousands of applicants throughout the world? Come join us.\n\nThrough our portfolio of leading enterprise software solutions, we ignite business performance for thousands of customers globally.

    "description": "At Loblaw Digital, we know that our customers expect the best from us. Whether that means building the best, most innovative online shopping experience, or designing an app that will impact the lives of people across the country, we’re up for the challenge. From our office in Downtown Toronto, we’ve created leading eCommerce experiences in the online grocery shopping, beauty, pharmacy, and apparel spaces, and we’re only just getting started.\n\nWhy is this role important?\n\nAs a Staff Developer, you will be working closely with the Software Development Managers to help oversee the technology vision, software quality and operational excellence. Partnering with the Engineering leads, you will define the technical metrics and outcomes for the teams to strive towards. Using your extensive knowledge and experience with technology, you will work with the other developers on those applications to further their growth and abilities.\n\nWhat You'll Do\n• Take ownership of the technological vision, software quality, and operational excellence for the eCommerce platform teams, including architecture, metrics and practices.\n• Lead by example in building great software. Get hands-on with the code, such as building a proof of concept, tackling a gnarly bug or feature. Participate in the design and delivery of new features in a collaborative agile/scrum environment.\n• Responsible for designing and implementing scalable and resilient systems that meet the needs of our rapidly growing business.\n• Find ways to coach and level-up the technical skills of multiple pods of developers using your knowledge and expertise. Provide mentoring, especially to Senior Developers. Drive reviews of technical artifacts.\n• Look out and advocate for opportunities to improve our technical processes to enable the best performance out of our teams as possible.\n• Build strong relationships with developers and peer technologists across the organization. Work collaboratively across practices, levels, and organizational structure to find the right solution. The solution of choice may be to reuse an existing enterprise standard, but it could also be to innovate our processes and technology.\n• Foster a culture of continuous inclusivity and improvement.\n\nDoes this sound like you?\n• Extensive experience (8+ years) with Java and a variety of technologies including distributed systems, microservices architecture.\n• Proven track record of working on large and complex software systems that span across teams.\n• Hands-on experience working with event-driven architecture and implementing solutions using this paradigm.\n• Experience working with Relational and NoSQL database at scale.\n• Professional experience with GCP or equivalent cloud technology.\n• You are a self-starter with a passion for building high-quality software, and thrive in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.\n• You are skilled at asking the right questions to understand new technology, and proficient at communicating the implications of high-level constraints and stakeholder decisions both verbally and in writing.\n• You are comfortable making decisions in the face of ambiguity. Your technology choices, designs, and architectures use as much data as is practical from a variety of sources.\n• You communicate clearly and effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences alike. You can present complicated solutions in a simple and logical way. Your diagrams are crisp and clean. Your documents are organized, clear, and concise.\n• You are a thought leader for innovation and will champion the optimization and maturing of technology practices in collaboration with key stakeholders.\n\nHow You’ll Succeed:\n\nAt Loblaw Digital, we seek great people to continually strengthen our culture. We believe great people model our values, are authentic, build trust and make connections.\n\nWe’re able to keep innovating because our colleagues are passionate about their work and excited about the future of eCommerce.\n\nIf you have big ideas, undeniable enthusiasm, and thrive in a collaborative, creative, and diverse group, we’ll get along just fine.\n\nLooking for a challenge? Good. Love an innovative work environment? Even better.\n\nApply today.\n\nEmployment Type:\nFull time\n\nType of Role:\nRegular\n\nLoblaw Digital recognizes Canada's diversity as a source of national pride and strength.

    "description": "Imagine if you could write Python code that doesn’t just move data—but moves the needle on how the modern insurance industry functions. You’re not building another feature flag for a SaaS dashboard. You’re writing backend systems that support machine learning models tasked with identifying truth (or at least a statistically reliable approximation of it) in an industry built on uncertainty: insurance.\n\nThis is not a vibe-based startup. It's a well-capitalized AI company where engineering decisions are consequential and the work is rooted in measurable outcomes. The product helps insurers detect fraudulent claims using a data-driven platform that aims to remove bias—because the stakes aren’t likes or clicks; they’re dollars and liability.\n\nYou’ll be the kind of engineer who prefers to spend time writing backend Python that automates infrastructure logic, builds internal tools, or glues together machine learning pipelines in AWS. Terraform is here, obviously. So are EC2, RDS, Lambda, and other expected acronyms. But what sets this apart is the opportunity to shape how it all functions—functionally.\n\nAnd yes, this role is onsite, in Toronto or Vancouver. You’ll be around other engineers who care about systems, not just shipping tickets.\nRequired Skills & Experience\n• 3–6 years of experience in software engineering, with real backend Python contributions—ideally building infrastructure tools, internal APIs, or deployment logic\n• Solid experience with AWS tooling and a habit of understanding the why, not just the how\n• Proven experience with infrastructure-as-code tooling like Terraform or AWS CDK\n\nDesired Skills & Experience\n• Comfort overseeing Monitoring and reliability\n\nFamiliarity with CI/CD tooling and systems that don’t fall apart under pressure\n\nDaily Responsibilities\n• Hands-On Engineering: 70%\n• Team Collaboration & Cross-Functional Work: 30%\n\nApplicants must be currently authorized to work in Canada on a full-time basis now and in the future.\n\nAccommodation will be provided in all parts of the hiring process as required under Motion Recruitment’s Employment Accommodation policy.

    "description": "It's no secret that traditional site reliability teams struggle to keep pace with manual monitoring, reactive troubleshooting, and labor-intensive deployments. The rise of AI presents a solution, but many companies fail to fully leverage its potential, resulting in systems that underperform and bottlenecks that stifle innovation. Data shows that 73% of companies struggle with deployment delays and operational downtime, primarily due to outdated processes and lack of AI-driven automation.\n\nAt IgniteTech, we are tackling these issues head-on by building AI-first cloud solutions that are designed to anticipate and prevent problems before they arise. We focus on integrating AI and machine learning into every facet of cloud infrastructure management, from automated monitoring systems to intelligent CI/CD pipelines. This approach creates environments that not only self-heal but also continuously evolve, reducing downtime, improving performance, and pushing the boundaries of what cloud services can do.\n\nThis isn’t your typical site reliability role, where you'd be reacting to problems and manually intervening when things go wrong. Here, you’ll lead the charge in building AI-enhanced monitoring systems that detect and resolve 95% of issues before they ever reach end users. You’ll also architect and manage AI-automated CI/CD pipelines that reduce deployment times by 30% while slashing manual interventions. The ideal candidate thrives in an AI-driven environment, is excited by the prospect of automation-first solutions, and enjoys pushing the envelope of cloud infrastructure design.\n\nIn this role, you’ll join a global team of innovators who are redefining cloud infrastructure.
